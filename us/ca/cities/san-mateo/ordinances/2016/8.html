            <p>WHEREAS, there is a shortage of affordable housing in the City of San Mateo as evidenced in the 2015-2023 Housing Element; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, commercial development in the City of San Mateo brings additional workers to the City of San Mateo and therefore contributes to the need for affordable housing; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, the City wishes to impose an affordable housing commercial linkage fee on commercial development to be contributed to the City's Affordable Housing Fund and used to fund the development of affordable housing in the City; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, the City wishes to provide an option for developers to apply for a fee waiver when it can be demonstrated that a particular project will not add to the City's need for affordable housing; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, the City of San Mateo wishes to exempt development that provides a public service, such as hospitals and schools, from payment of the affordable housing commercial linkage fee; and;</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, the City Council has determined that the development of an area standard wage policy would enhance local job opportunities and increase wages of workers and residents in the City; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, the City has determined that the payment by commercial development projects of "Area Standard Wages" which are defined as the general prevailing wage determinations for San Mateo County as made by the State of California Director of the Department of Industrial Relations, will increase certain households' ability to afford housing in the County, thereby reducing the impact of those commercial development projects on the need for affordable housing in the City; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, the City has provided the notice required by Government Code sections 66016-66019 and 6062a;</p>
            <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA, ORDAINS that:</p>
            <p id="1"><span class="level-num">Section 1. CITY COUNCIL MAKES THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS.</span> </p>
            <p>The provision of safe and stable housing for households at all income levels in essential for the public welfare of the City.  Housing in the City of San Mateo has become steadily more expensive and housing costs have gone up faster than incomes.  Federal and state government programs do not provide enough affordable housing to satisfy the needs of very low, low, or moderate income households.  As a result, there is a severe shortage of adequate, affordable housing for very low, lower, and moderate income households, as evidenced by the following findings in the City's 2015 – 2023 Housing Element:</p>
            <p>Average market rents increased 24-31% between 2010-2013.</p>
            <p>More than 55% of low income renters and owners are cost burdened by paying more than 30% of their income for their housing; and 90% of very low income renters and 60% of very low income owners pay more than 50% of their income for their housing</p>
            <p>Only 28.9% of the homes are affordable to purchase for median income households in the San Francisco, San Mateo County Division Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is the least affordable area in the state.</p>
            <p>As provided in the Housing Element of the General Plan, the City wishes to be a leader in providing resources to facilitate the development of housing, and especially affordable housing, within its borders as outlined in the Goal H.2 Encourage New Housing Construction, includingH-2.2 which calls for maintaining the housing/jobs balance and H-2.3 which calls for the use of public funds for affordable housing to assist low and moderate income households, giving priority to very low income housing. H-2.4 encourages the promotion of the private development of affordable housing through its inclusionary program, as well as consideration of the adoption of a commercial linkage fee.</p>
            <p>Because commercial development attracts employees, of whom a quantifiable number will have very low, low, or moderate incomes, new commercial developments increase the demand for and exacerbate the shortage of housing available for people at those levels while also reducing the supply of land potentially available for housing development.</p>
            <p>Based on the findings above, the City desires to further the public health, safety and welfare by requiring commercial development projects in the City to mitigate their impact on the need for affordable housing in the City.</p>
            <p>The City may adopt an affordable housing commercial linkage fee under the authority of the California Constitution Article XI, Section 7, which provides: "A county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws," and in accordance with the findings set forth in the ordinance codified in this Chapter.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">(a)</span> As an alternative to compliance with the basic provisions included in Section 23.61.030 of this Chapter, developers of commercial development projects may propose the construction of affordable units on site or an alternative mitigation program proposed by the developer and the community development director, such as the provision of off-site affordable units, donation of land for the construction of affordable units, or purchase of existing units for conversion to affordable units.</p>
