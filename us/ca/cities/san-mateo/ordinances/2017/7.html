            <p>WHEREAS, the procedures set forth in Article XIIID § 6 of the California State Constitution (Proposition 218) for property-related fees apply to sewer service charge increases; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, the City is following the procedure set forth in Article XIIID § 6 for this Sewer Service Charge increase; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, notice of the proposed Sewer Service Charge increase was mailed to ratepayers and property owners on May 1, 2017; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, a public hearing regarding the proposed Sewer Service Charge is scheduled for June 19, 2017, at 7:00 p.m. in the San Mateo City Hall Council Chambers, located at 330 West 20th Avenue, San Mateo, at which all protests against the rate increase and other comments will be considered; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, in accordance with Article XIIID § 6 of the California Constitution:</p>
            <p>The revenues derived from the Sewer Service Charge do not exceed the funds required to provide sewer service because the rate increase is needed to fund ongoing sewer system operation and maintenance and meet capital expenditures,</p>
            <p>The revenues derived from the Sewer Service Charge will not be used for any purpose other than the provision of sewer service,</p>
            <p>The Sewer Service Charge will not exceed the cost of sewer service attributable to each parcel,</p>
            <p>The Sewer Service Charge is only charged for sewer service that is actually used by or currently available to the parcel in question,</p>
            <p>The Sewer Service Charge pays for the provision of sewer service and not for general governmental services; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, San Mateo Municipal Code section 3.54.030 provides the Council shall annually establish the Sewer Service Charge by ordinance.</p>

PUBLICATION.</span> This Ordinance shall be published in summary in the San Francisco Examiner, posted in the City Clerk's Office, and posted on the City's website, all in accord with Section 2.15 of the Charter and shall be effective 30 days after the date of adoption.</p>
