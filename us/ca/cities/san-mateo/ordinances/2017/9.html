            <p id="1"><span class="level-num">Section 1.</span> Chapter 7.22 of the San Mateo Municipal Code is hereby amended to read:</p>

            <p>This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority provided in Government Code Sections 38771 through 38773.5 and pursuant to the City's police powers. The purpose of this chapter is to identify activity which constitutes a public nuisance, to provide for the summary abatement of such a nuisance at the expense of the persons creating, causing, committing or maintaining it, and to promote the public peace, health, safety and welfare by minimizing the frequency of occurrences requiring calls for service to unruly gatherings which disturb the public peace and threaten the general welfare and to promote the reduction of underage drinking by imposing penalties upon responsible persons for unruly gatherings where alcohol is consumed by, served to or in the possession of underage persons.

            </p>
            <p>It is declared that unruly gatherings constitute a public nuisance as defined by Chapter 7.16. No person, firm, corporation, association, or other legal entity owning, leasing, renting, or occupying real property in the City shall create, cause, commit, maintain, or permit such a public nuisance to occur on such property.</p>

              <span class="level-num">7.22.030 RESPONSE TO UNRULY GATHERINGS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">(a)</span> First Response. Upon a report of an unruly or potentially unruly gathering, a duly authorized officer or employee of the City may respond to the incident and make a preliminary determination as to whether the incident constitutes or may constitute an unruly gathering. If the officer or employee determines that the incident constitutes or may constitute an unruly gathering, the officer or employee may issue a written warning to the person apparently in charge of the gathering that contains information in substantial conformance to the following:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="">(1)</span> The conduct of the gathering constitutes or may constitute an unruly gathering under the Municipal Code or State law; and</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="">(2)</span> Unless the conduct of the gathering is adjusted, the continuance at the level or in the manner determined may result in the arrest or citation of persons participating in the gathering; and</p>
            <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="">(3)</span> If an officer or employee responds to the gathering again in order to seek the abatement of the conduct or manner of the gathering, the full costs to the City of that response or any further response may be charged to the owner, tenant or occupant of the property on which the gathering is occurring, as well as to the person in charge of the property and the person who organized the gathering.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">(b)</span> Second and Further Responses. If, after a first notice has been given as provided above, a duly authorized officer or employee of the City responds to a gathering that is then an unruly gathering, the officer or employee may take such further abatement steps as the officer or employee believes reasonable to abate the unruly gathering as provided by State and City laws. The response costs of those abatement steps may be compiled and reported to the City Manager for hearing and assessment of the response costs against the property owner as provided in Chapter 7.42.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">(c)</span> The issuance of an entertainment permit under Chapter 5.43 of this Code shall constitute the issuance of a written warning for the purposes of this section, if the permit states on its face that the permittee is warned that the permittee shall be responsible for the costs of any emergency response if such response is required to abate an unruly gathering at the location for which the entertainment permit was issued. Accordingly, if an entertainment permit contains the warning stated herein, the permittee shall be liable under the provisions of this chapter for the costs of responding to and abating an unruly gathering at a permitted establishment if the abatement requires an emergency response. (Ord. 2004-15 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1991-17 § 1, 1991).</p>

Evidence that a person was requested to leave such a gathering and refused or failed to do so shall be rebuttable proof that that person committed and maintained an unruly gathering. In establishing the costs and liability incurred as to persons who are not owners of the real property involved, the City shall provide a notice and hearing process before the City Council in substantial conformance to that provided to the owners of real property pursuant to Chapter 7.42.

If a person who has control of the premises where the unruly gathering occurs or the person who organizes the gathering is a juvenile, the juvenile and the parents or guardians of the juvenile will be jointly and severally liable for the response costs incurred when public safety services were utilized in responding to an unruly gathering where alcohol was served to, consumed by or in the possession of underage persons.</p>
