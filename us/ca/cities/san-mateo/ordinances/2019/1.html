            <p>WHEREAS, <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/charter#2.16" title="2.16 EMERGENCY ORDINANCES.">City Charter Section 2.16</a> provides that the City Council, to protect public peace health, safety, and welfare, may adopt as an emergency ordinance, an ordinance passed by a majority plus one of the City Council; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, the City has received interest from commercial operators in operating electronic scooter businesses in the City; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, the commercial operation of electronic scooter businesses is designed such that electronic scooters are left in place at any location in the City and often within the public right of way; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, City staff has monitored e-scooter commercial operations in other California communities and noted the following safety issues:</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">a.</span> Cities in which e-scooter businesses operate have observed an increase in scooter-related injuries including broken bones, head injuries, and a few fatalities.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">b.</span> E-scooters can achieve speeds of up to 15 miles per hour and while e-scooters are intended for use on streets they are often operated on sidewalks, which poses a safety threat to pedestrians.</p>
            <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">c.</span> E-scooters provided by commercial operators are often left in place on the public right of way. E-scooters are very easily knocked over thus posing a tripping hazard to pedestrians and obstructing the right of way.</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/charter#2.16" title="2.16 EMERGENCY ORDINANCES.">City Charter Section 2.16</a>, an emergency ordinance expires on the 91st day after its adoption but may be re-enacted if the emergency still exists; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, on November 19, 2018 the City Council of the City of San Mateo adopted an emergency ordinance temporarily prohibiting the commercial operation of electric scooter businesses; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, the emergency ordinance is scheduled to expire on February 17, 2019; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, staff continues to have concerns regarding the safety of electronic scooters for users, pedestrians, and motor vehicles; and</p>
            <p>WHEREAS, staff is researching the optional methods to regulate electric scooter businesses in order to protect public peace, health, safety and welfare;</p>
            <p>NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO FINDS AND ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic"/>
            <p id="1"><span class="level-num">Section 1.</span> That the above recitals are true and correct and are adopted as the City Council's findings.</p>
            <p id="2"><span class="level-num">Section 2.</span> For the immediate presentation of public peace, health, safety, and welfare, pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/charter#2.16" title="2.16 EMERGENCY ORDINANCES.">City Charter Section 2.16</a>, the commercial operation of electronic scooter businesses is prohibited while this ordinance remains in effect.</p>
            <p id="3"><span class="level-num">Section 3.</span> That City staff is directed to study the details of electronic scooter businesses and report back to the City Council in an expeditious manner and prior to the expiration of this ordinance.</p>
            <p id="4"><span class="level-num">Section 4.</span> This ordinance is declared to be an emergency measure and interim ordinance adopted pursuant to the provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/charter#2.16" title="2.16 EMERGENCY ORDINANCES.">City Charter Section 2.16</a>.

            <p id="7"><span class="level-num">Section 7.
