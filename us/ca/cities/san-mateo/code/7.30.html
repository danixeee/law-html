The sound level shall be determined with the noise source at issue silent and in the same location as the measurement of the noise level of the source or sources at issue. If for any reason the alleged offending noise source cannot be shut down, the ambient noise must be estimated by performing a measurement in the same general area of the source but at a sufficient distance that the noise from the source is at least 10 dB below the ambient so that only the ambient level is measured. If the difference between the ambient and the noise source is five to nine dB, then the level of the ambient itself can be determined by subtracting a one dB correction to account for the contribution of the source.</p>
