Said facts and testimony may include testimony on the condition of the vehicle or parts thereof and the circumstances concerning its location on the private property or public property. The hearing officer shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land may appear in person at the hearing or present a sworn written statement in time for consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his or her reasons for such denial.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The hearing officer may impose such conditions and take such other action as he or she deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7/17/">this chapter</a>. He or she may delay the time for removal of the vehicle or parts thereof if, in his or her opinion, the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the hearing officer may find that a vehicle or parts thereof has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public property and order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as hereinafter provided and determine the administrative costs and the cost of removal to be charged against the owner of the land. The order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle or parts thereof and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the site.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed without the consent of the owner of the land and that he or she has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the hearing officer shall not assess the costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such owner of the land.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> If the owner of the land submits a sworn, written statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his or her land but does not appear, or if an interested party makes a written presentation to the hearing officer but does not appear, he or she shall be notified in writing of the decision.</p>
