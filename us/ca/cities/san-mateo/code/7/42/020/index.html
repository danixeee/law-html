The expenses and costs incurred will include all expenses and costs, both direct and indirect, that the City incurred, including but not limited to remediation, administration, investigation, boundary determination, measurement, clerical, legal, and other related costs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Any lumber or other building materials salvaged from the abatement that the Manager, or the Manager's designated representative, determines can be reasonably sold at public auction will be advertised for public sale in a newspaper of general circulation. The Manager or Manager's designated representative will then cause the lumber or other building materials at public auction to be sold not earlier than five (5) days following advertisement. Any amount received from any sales of materials removed from the property involved will be deducted from the costs and expenses incurred in the abatement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Any personal property salvaged from the abatement will be stored by City as an expense of the property owner or, in the alternative, may be delivered to the known address of the owner of the personal property. The property owners and the occupants of the property will be notified of the storage, and the property will be made available for pick-up by the apparent owners upon payment of the storage expenses. The City will store the personal property for at least ninety (90) days after the abatement. At any time after that period, the personal property that the City Manager, or the Manager's designated representative, determines can reasonably be sold at public auction will be advertised for public sale in a newspaper of general circulation. The Manager or Manager's designated representative will then cause the personal property to be sold at public auction not earlier than five (5) days following advertisement. If the personal property is unsold after the auction, the City may dispose of it as the Manager determines is most efficient. Any amount received from any sales of the personal property removed from the property involved will be deducted from the costs and expenses incurred in the abatement.</p>
