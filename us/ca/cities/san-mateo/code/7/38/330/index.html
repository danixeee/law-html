                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be conducted as part of any monitoring requirement of a waste discharge permit or other formal directive shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in the pretreatment regulations. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> All samples shall be representative of the waste being analyzed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Samples shall be analyzed by a laboratory accredited by the California Department of Health Services for such analysis.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> All analytical data and flow monitoring records shall include the date, exact location, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates that the analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the Industrial User file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil &amp; grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the Director, as appropriate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. For other required reports the Director shall require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance by Industrial Users with Applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.</p>
