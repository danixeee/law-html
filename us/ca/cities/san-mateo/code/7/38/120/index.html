The categorical pretreatment standards provided in the pretreatment regulations shall apply to all applicable sources. Nothing in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7/38/">this chapter</a> shall be construed as allowing less stringent limitations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Local Limits. Local limits for toxic pollutants shall be developed by the Director to protect the POTW from interference, pass-through, and the other general discharge prohibitions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Explosives. No solids, liquids, or gases shall be discharged which by themselves or by interaction with other substances may cause a fire or explosion hazard including, but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Neither shall any substance be discharged which causes two (2) readings on an explosion hazard meter of more than five percent of the lower explosive limit, or any single reading over 10% of the lower explosive limit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Corrosives. Discharges with a pH of less than 5.0 or more than 10.5, or other discharges which may cause corrosive structural damage to the sanitary sewer system, are prohibited.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Solids or Viscous Materials. No solid or viscous materials shall be discharged in amounts which will cause or contribute to obstruction of flow in the sanitary sewer system. Such materials include, but are not limited to, sand, glass, metal chips, bone, plastics, sludge, mud, straw, wood, bags, rags, grease from commercial kitchen operations, and particulate matter which cannot pass through a one-half inch screen.</p>

No person shall discharge pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration that, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause interference with wastewater treatment processes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Heat. No waste shall be discharged in amounts that will inhibit POTW treatment processes resulting in interference; including heat in such quantities that the temperature at the POTW exceeds 40 degrees C (140 degrees F).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> Oil and Grease. Oil and grease shall not be discharged into the sewer system if average concentration of floatable oil and grease exceeds 20 mg/L, defined as that which is subject to gravity separation at a temperature of 20 degrees C and at pH 4.5; nor shall the total oil and grease concentration exceed 200 mg/L. In addition, the discharge of petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral origin in amounts that will cause interfere and pass-through, are prohibited.</p>

No industrial waste shall be discharged which alone or in combination with other wastes may create a public nuisance, a hazard, make human entry into the sewers unsafe, or which constitutes a discharge of hazardous substances as defined by <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/22/">Title 22</a>, Part II of the California Code of Regulations; or statutes of the United States government. Dissolved sulfides shall not be discharged in concentrations exceeding 0.1 mg/liter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> Trucked or Hauled Wastes. Discharge of trucked or hauled waste is prohibited, except as expressly authorized in a waste discharge permit. The permit shall specify the exact point of discharge of the waste.</p>
