                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Baseline monitoring reports shall contain the name and address of the user, including name of owner and operator; list of any environmental control permits held by the user; description of operations, including rate of production, standard industrial classification, and process schematic; estimated average and maximum daily flow to sanitary sewer from the regulated processes to allow use of the combined waste stream formula in the pretreatment regulations; identification of the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each process; results of sampling and analysis of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process, or, in the case of new sources, an estimate of such pollutants.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Baseline reports shall contain a statement, reviewed by an authorized representative of the user and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether or not pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.</p>

The compliance schedule shall include progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards. Such events may include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation.</p>
