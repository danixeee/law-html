                <p>The formulation and enactment of a comprehensive zoning code is based on the division of the entire City into districts in each of which are permitted specified uses that are mutually compatible. In addition to such permitted compatible uses, however, it is recognized that there are other uses which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given district but which on account of their potential influence upon neighboring uses or public facilities need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or operation for the protection of the community. Such uses are classified in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27" title="Title 27 ZONING">this title</a> as "special uses" and fall into three (3) categories:</p>

Other nondesignated uses which the Planning Commission concludes are so similar to any specifically allowed use in the district as to be virtually identical thereto in terms of impact and land use requirements may also be allowed as special uses.

Any physical alteration, physical expansion, or change of an existing approved special use shall require a review by and be final with the Planning Commission, unless appealed to the City Council in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27.08.060" title="27.08.060 DECISIONS FINAL.">Section 27.08.060</a>.
