                <p>This special permit is intended to enable and encourage flexibility of design and development of land in such a manner as to promote its most appropriate use; to allow diversification in the relationship of various uses, structures and space; to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities; to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open space; to offer recreational opportunities close to home; to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through preservation of natural green spaces, and to counteract the effects of urban congestion and monotony. The proposed development must be designed to provide an environment of a stable and desirable character, and must provide permanently reserved useable open space and areas for off-street parking adequate for the occupancy proposed. In residential development, it must include provision for open space and recreation areas to meet the needs of the anticipated population.</p>
