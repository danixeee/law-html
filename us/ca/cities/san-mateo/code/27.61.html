                <p>Prior to occupancy of any zoning plot developed pursuant to senior citizen regulations, the project's proponent shall provide documentation limiting the use of the project to senior citizen housing exclusively and vesting in the City the right to enforce such limitation until and unless it determines that any proposed alternate use complies fully with regulations pertaining to the underlying district. Such documentation may consist of subdivision or parcel map dedication, covenants, conditions and restrictions pertaining to the zoning plot or a recordable use restriction. Any such documentation shall be in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney.</p>
