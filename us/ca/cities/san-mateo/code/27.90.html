                <p>The purpose of the Transit Oriented Development (TOD) district is to implement the San Mateo Rail Corridor Transit Oriented Development Plan (Rail Corridor Plan). The TOD policies of the Rail Corridor Plan encourage more intensive development within walking distance of transit stations. TOD is intended to provide for an integrated mix of land uses that support transit use through site design that enhances accessibility to stations and is supportive of pedestrian and bicycle use.</p>
