                <p>The planning commission may grant floor area bonuses for the provision of open space in R5 developments if such open space is provided for recreational purposes and is intended to meet the needs of the inhabitants. In determining the suitability of the proposed open space, the following shall be considered:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27.26.080#(1)">(1)</span> The park and recreation element of the general plan;</p>

                <p>The open space and recreation facilities will be analyzed as part of the required site plan and architectural review (SPAR) and may be granted a bonus by recommendation of the approval body if these facilities are found to meet the recreational needs of the project residents as being adequate in size and number.</p>
                <p>To earn a floor area bonus for any project feature, a development must earn a bonus from each of the three categories below in this section. In order to earn any bonus provision, a development must include increased natural landscaping. However, not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of natural landscaping in pots or planters shall be counted for the purpose of determining the amount of any floor area bonus.</p>
                <p>Open space and recreation facilities may be located in required yards under the conditions provided in the open space bonus standards.</p>
                <p>The following project features may qualify for floor area ratio bonuses when the criteria are met:</p>

In order to qualify for a bonus, the natural landscaping or water feature must be provided in addition to the required yards and be open to the sky. The minimum bonus required is 0.35.</p>
