              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p>The Chief of Police or authorized representative may revoke or suspend a permit if any of the following are found: the permittee does not possess the qualifications for the permit as required by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5.49" title="Chapter 5.49 TANNING FACILITIES">this chapter</a>; has been convicted of any violation of the provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5.49" title="Chapter 5.49 TANNING FACILITIES">this chapter</a> or any lesser included offense; has made a material misrepresentation on the permit application or renewal; has engaged in conduct or operated the tanning facility in a manner which violates any of the mandatory provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5.49" title="Chapter 5.49 TANNING FACILITIES">this chapter</a>, any conditions of the permit, or any of the laws which would have been grounds for denial of the permit. For purposes of this section, permittee shall include the managing responsible officer or employee. Further, the permittee shall be responsible for those acts of its employees which are done in the course and scope of their employment by the permittee.</p>
                <p>A hearing shall be scheduled upon not less that 10 calendar days notice to the permittee stating the grounds for proposed revocation or suspension. Notice shall be given by personal service or certified mail to the address shown on the last application or renewal. If reasonable attempts to otherwise serve are not successful, service may be provided by first class mail.</p>
                <p>Notice of the decision shall be given in the same manner as for the hearing. The decision of the Chief of Police or authorized representative may be appealed by the permittee to the City Manager within 15 calendar days of service by filing written notice of appeal with the City Manager's office stating the basis for the appeal and the errors claimed to have occurred. If the permit is suspended or revoked, the permit shall be surrendered.</p>
                <p>Service shall be deemed complete when personal service is made, when the certified letter is delivered, or when the decision is mailed by first class mail.</p>
