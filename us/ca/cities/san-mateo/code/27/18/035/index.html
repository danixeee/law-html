                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> A special use permit shall be required for the substantial removal of an existing residence, regardless of whether it is currently inhabited. "Substantial removal" shall mean the demolition of 50% or more of the structure's exterior walls (measured in lineal feet) and/or roof (measured in square feet). Existing exterior walls that are converted to interior walls shall be counted as walls to be demolished. Substantial removal for a roof shall not apply to permit applications for re-roofing where roof pitch alterations do not exceed an increase in height of more than two (2) feet as measured at the highest point or where a Single Family Dwelling Design Review (SFDDR) planning application has been submitted as part of the proposed dwelling's improvements. Doors, including garage doors, entry doors, and sliding glass doors, shall not be included in the percentage calculation of an existing structure's exterior walls. This section shall not apply to an accessory building or to a residence that has been declared a public nuisance under this Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> No existing residence may be substantially removed unless either: (1) an application for a residence is submitted concurrently with the application for removal and is approved pursuant to the SFDDR procedures; or (2) plans for a permitted use other than a residence are submitted concurrently with the application for removal and, if the permitted use does not contain a principal structure, removal shall be conditioned upon subsequent SFDDR of a new principal structure; or (3) application for a special use permit is submitted concurrently with the application for removal and is approved; if the special use permit does not contain a principal structure, removal shall be conditioned upon subsequent SFDDR of a new principal structure.</p>
