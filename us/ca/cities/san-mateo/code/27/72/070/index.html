In the event the damage or destruction is less than fifty percent of its replacement value, based upon prevailing construction costs, the building may then be restored to its original condition and the occupancy use of such building which existed at the time of such partial destruction may be continued. In either event, restoration or repair of the building or other structure must be started within a period of six months from the date of damage or destruction and diligently prosecuted to completion.</p>
