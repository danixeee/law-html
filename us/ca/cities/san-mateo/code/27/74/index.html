                <p>The formulation and enactment of a comprehensive zoning code is based on the division of the entire City into districts in each of which are permitted specified uses that are mutually compatible. In addition to such permitted compatible uses, however, it is recognized that there are other uses which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given district but which on account of their potential influence upon neighboring uses or public facilities need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or operation for the protection of the community. Such uses are classified in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/">this title</a> as "special uses" and fall into three (3) categories:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Use either municipally operated or operated by publicly regulated utilities or uses traditionally affected by public interest;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> Uses entirely private in character which, on account of their peculiar locational need, the nature of the service they offer to the public, and their possibly damaging influence on the neighborhood, may be established in a district or districts in which they cannot reasonably be allowed as an unrestricted permitted use under the zoning regulations; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> Nonconforming uses which as special use permits can be made more compatible with their surroundings.</p>

                <p>Power to grant a special use permit shall be limited to those uses designated as "special use" within the districts established under <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/">this title</a>. Other nondesignated uses which the Planning Commission concludes are so similar to any specifically allowed use in the district as to be virtually identical thereto in terms of impact and land use requirements may also be allowed as special uses. The appropriate approval body shall have the power to hear evidence that the granting of such permit will or will not adversely affect the general health, safety and/or welfare of the community, and that the use, if permitted, will not cause injury or disturbance to adjacent property traffic or by excessive noise, smoke, odor or noxious gas, dust, glare, heat or fumes, or industrial waste. Any physical alteration, physical expansion, or change of an existing approved special use shall require a review by and be final with the Planning Commission, unless appealed to the City Council in accordance with <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/08/060/">Section 27.08.060</a>. Any use designated as a "special use," but which does not currently have a special use permit, shall be required to procure a special use permit from the appropriate approval body for any physical alteration, physical expansion, or change of the use.</p>
