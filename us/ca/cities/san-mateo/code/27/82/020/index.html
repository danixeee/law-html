                <p>Whenever any uncertainty exists as to the boundary of any zoning district as shown on the zoning maps incorporated herein, the following rules shall apply:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Where district boundary lies are indicated as following streets, alleys, or similar rights-of-way, they shall be construed as following the centerlines thereof;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Where district boundary lines are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Where a lot or parcel held in one ownership which is incapable of being subdivided and is of record on the effective date of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/">this title</a> is divided by a "district" boundary line, the entire lot or parcel shall be construed to be within the "district" containing more than half the area of the lot or parcel, provided the property is developed as one unit. If the lot or parcel is divided into equal parts it shall be deemed to be in the most restricted district. This does not apply to unplatted or unmapped parcels. If an unplatted or unmapped parcel held in one ownership is divided by a district boundary line, the portions of the parcel shown on the zoning map shall be construed to be in the district in which they are shown on the zoning map;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Where a street shall hereafter have been vacated or abandoned and such street was, prior to the adoption hereof, the division line or boundary between two districts, the centerline of the vacated or abandoned street shall remain the boundary between districts unless otherwise determined by the City Council;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> In case any uncertainty may exist as to the location of a boundary or boundaries of any district, and there is a dispute with reference hereto, the person or persons so disputing such boundary or boundaries shall file an appeal with the Planning Commission in compliance with the provisions and procedures set forth in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/08/">Chapter 27.08</a>.</p>
