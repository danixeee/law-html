The physical extent of the seating encroachment must be located so as to permanently maintain a minimum sidewalk pedestrian through zone of four (4) feet, free and clear between: (A) the outer boundary of the seating area and any physical obstruction, such as light standards, parking meters, news racks, trees, curb or other barrier; and (B) the entryways or display window of adjacent businesses, unless authorized by the adjacent business.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Physical Delineation of Seating Area. The physical extent of the seating encroachment may be clearly delineated by physical means, which, if either required or voluntarily placed, shall be approved as part of the encroachment permit and designed to be decorative, durable, removable and minimize tripping hazards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Other Limitations. Tables, seating and any approved physical barriers to delineate the seating area are the only items permitted to be located on the sidewalk. These items shall be removed from the public sidewalk at the close of business each day. Other items, such as busing stations, are not permitted on public sidewalks.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> Liability Insurance.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> Site Maintenance. Sidewalk seating areas shall be maintained free of litter, refuse and debris. The area shall be scrubbed and mopped to remove any food or drink stains on a daily basis. Such cleaning shall be performed in accordance with the City's Stormwater Management and Discharge Control Program, which prohibits any discharge other than stormwater into the stormwater drainage system. The applicant shall post maintenance security in a form and amount determined upon issuance of the encroachment permit. Failure to maintain the site shall be cause for termination of the encroachment permit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)">(6)</span> Encroachment Fee. The applicant shall pay an annual fee in the amount set forth in the Comprehensive Fee Schedule.</p>
