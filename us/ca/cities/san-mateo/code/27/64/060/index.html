                <p>The location of off-street parking facilities in relation to the use served shall be governed by the following provisions:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Residential Districts. Parking facilities accessory to dwelling units shall be located on the same parcel as the use served except as provided in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/64/100/">Section 27.64.100</a>. Spaces accessory to uses other than dwellings (such as churches) may be located on a plot adjacent to, or directly across a street or alley from the plot occupied by the use served if a special use permit is obtained from the Planning Commission; but in no case at a walking distance in excess of 200 feet from such use.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> Nonresidential Districts. Parking facilities accessory to dwelling units shall be located on the same parcel as the use served, except as provided in Section 27.64.200. Parking facilities accessory to uses other than dwellings may be located on other than the same parcel as the use served (off-site) if a special use permit is obtained from the Planning Commission. Unless otherwise required, all required parking spaces shall be within a walking distance of 500 feet of the use served. No parking spaces accessory to a use in a commercial, executive, or manufacturing district shall be located in a residential district, unless authorized by the Planning Commission through a special use permit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(2)(A)">(A)</span> Where required parking facilities are provided on land other than the parcel on which the building or use served by such facilities is located, they shall be and remain in the same possession and ownership as that of the parcel occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory except that the Planning Commission may authorize the use of leased, off-site land for the provision of required parking in either of the following cases:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(2)(A)(i)">(i)</span> The term of the lease approximates the expected life of the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory and the lessor and the applicant acknowledge in writing recorded to the satisfaction of the City that a failure to continuously maintain the total number of spaces required shall require the immediate reduction of the intensity of the use served to the extent necessary to bring it into full conformance with the parking requirements of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/64/">this chapter</a>; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(2)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> The number of required parking spaces leased for a shorter term does not exceed 25% of the total number of required parking spaces and the applicant and lessor acknowledge this restriction in writing as specified in subsection (i) above.</p>
