                <p>The planning commission may grant floor area bonuses for the provision of open space in R5 developments if such open space is provided for recreational purposes and is intended to meet the needs of the inhabitants. In determining the suitability of the proposed open space, the following shall be considered:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> The park and recreation element of the general plan;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> The composition of the anticipated population of the development;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> Such other factors and considerations which bear a reasonable relationship to the need for open space.</p>
                <p>The open space and recreation facilities will be analyzed as part of the required site plan and architectural review (SPAR) and may be granted a bonus by recommendation of the approval body if these facilities are found to meet the recreational needs of the project residents as being adequate in size and number.</p>
                <p>To earn a floor area bonus for any project feature, a development must earn a bonus from each of the three categories below in this section. In order to earn any bonus provision, a development must include increased natural landscaping. However, not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of natural landscaping in pots or planters shall be counted for the purpose of determining the amount of any floor area bonus.</p>
                <p>Open space and recreation facilities may be located in required yards under the conditions provided in the open space bonus standards.</p>
                <p>The following project features may qualify for floor area ratio bonuses when the criteria are met:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Outdoor Open Space. Open space bonuses may be granted for provision of natural landscaping, court games and field sports areas as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(a)">(a)</span> Each two percent (2%) of net parcel area devoted to natural landscaping or water features may be granted a floor area ratio bonus of 0.1, up to a maximum of 0.8. In order to qualify for a bonus, the natural landscaping or water feature must be provided in addition to the required yards and be open to the sky. The minimum bonus required is 0.35.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(b)">(b)</span> For each court game a floor area ratio bonus of 0.05 may be granted, up to a maximum of 0.1.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(1)(c)">(c)</span> For each open field sports area, a floor area bonus of 0.05 may be granted, up to a maximum of 0.1.</p>
                <p>The maximum bonus floor area ratio granted for the provision of exterior open spaces is 1.0.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> Indoor Recreation Space. Open space bonuses may be granted for provision of recreation room, as follows:</p>
                <p>For each five-hundred (500) square-foot unit of recreation room floor area, a ratio bonus of 0.05 will be granted to a maximum of 0.2.</p>
                <p>The maximum bonus floor area ratio for interior open space is 0.2.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> Open Space and Recreation Special Features. Open space bonuses may be granted for provision of special activity facilities, plazas, and swimming pools as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(a)">(a)</span> For each exterior special interest activity area, a floor area bonus of 0.05 may be granted, up to a maximum of 0.1.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)">(b)</span> For each exterior plaza area, a floor area bonus of 0.05 may be granted, up to a maximum of 0.1.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(c)">(c)</span> For an indoor or outdoor swimming pool, a floor area bonus of 0.15 may be granted. For an indoor or outdoor spa, a floor area bonus of 0.05 may be granted.</p>
                <p>The maximum bonus for swimming pool facilities is 0.2.</p>
