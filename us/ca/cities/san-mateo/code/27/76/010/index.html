                <p>The rate of emission of particulate matter from all sources within the boundaries of any lot shall not exceed the net figure in pounds per acre of lot area prescribed in the regulations for the manufacturing district in which the lot is located after deducting from the gross hourly emission per acre the correction factors set forth in the appropriate tables incorporated hereafter for height, velocity and temperature of emission. The method for determining the total net rate of emission of particulate matter within the boundaries of any lot shall be as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Determine the maximum emission in pounds per hour from each source of emission within the lot boundaries and divide each figure by the number of acres of lot area, thereby obtaining the gross hourly rate of emission in pounds per acre for each source of emission;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> From each gross hourly rate of emission derived in (1), deduct the appropriate correction factor (interpolating as required) for height, velocity, and temperature of emission as set forth in the tables which follow, in Sections <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/76/020/">27.76.020</a> through <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/76/040/">27.76.040</a>, thereby obtaining the net rate of emission in pounds per acre of lot area for each source of emission;</p>

Such total shall not exceed the number of pounds per acre of lot area during any one hour prescribed as maximum for the district in which the lot is located.</p>
