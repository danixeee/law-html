Tree protection measures shall be provided for trees to remain on-site, which shall be consistent with <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/52/025/">Section 13.52.025</a> of the municipal code and imposed as a condition of approvals.</p>

If the required LU value for replacement of existing trees to be removed is not made up with replacement trees on-site, the City shall require that trees be planted in another location on-site or off-site or a contribution of funds be made to the City to be used for plantings on public land or a combination of the above options. If a contribution of funds is required, it shall be the fee as established by resolution of the City Council in the annual Comprehensive Fee Schedule.</p>
