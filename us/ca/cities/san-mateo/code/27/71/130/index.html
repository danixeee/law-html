                <p>The following requirements shall apply to open parking areas containing five or more parking spaces.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Setbacks. Whenever a parking area is located adjacent to any residential use or zone and along all street frontages, a landscape strip shall be provided that is equal in width to five percent of the parking lot depth or six feet, whichever is greater.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Percentage of Parking Areas to be Landscaped. At least 10% of the open parking area shall be landscaped. The following shall be considered in computing the landscape area:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> Parking area includes all paved surfaces devoted to on-site circulation and parking;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Only those landscaped areas within six feet of a parking stall or aisle shall apply towards meeting the 10% requirement;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Areas to be considered shall include planting areas and required curbing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Screening. All open parking areas shall be effectively screened on each side adjoining or fronting on any property in a residential zone and along all street frontages. Screening of adjoining property shall be a minimum of four feet to a maximum of six feet in height. Screening along street frontages shall be at least two and one-half feet in height for at least 80% of its length. Screening shall be accomplished by a wall, fence, earth berm, densely planted shrub mass or any combination of the above. Where walls or fences are provided, they shall be located adjacent to the edge of the parking lots. Screening shall conform with the sight distance requirements contained in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/84/">Chapter 27.84</a> of the San Mateo Municipal Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Parking Lot Islands.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> All islands and small areas unused for parking or circulation shall be landscaped. The Zoning Administrator may determine that certain areas for reasons of size, aesthetics or circulation should not be landscaped and may approve paving in those areas.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> Interior landscape islands, having a minimum dimension of five feet including curb, shall be provided after every 10 parking spaces in a row to provide for tree planting.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Required Trees. For each three parking spaces at least one tree shall be planted within the parking lot landscaped area in addition to any required street trees. Existing trees may be included in the required total.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Protection of Planting Areas. All planting areas shall be protected from common vehicular traffic. For parking lots containing five stalls or more, this requirement shall be met by a six-inch-high vertical concrete curb. For parking lots containing less than five stalls, this requirement may be met by a concrete wheel stop in front of each diagonal or perpendicular stall plus a minimum six-inch-high concrete curb in other areas or approved equal. No trees or shrubs shall be planted and sprinkler heads shall be kept below curb height within two feet six inches of any curb or wheel stops which front upon parking stalls or backup areas.</p>
