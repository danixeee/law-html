                <p>Spacing and distances between principal buildings shall be at least equivalent to that required by the zoning district unless the applicant demonstrates that:</p>

Decreased setbacks may be allowed where the applicant demonstrates that a better or more appropriate design can be achieved by the allowance of a reduced setback and adherence to the setback requirements of immediately adjacent property is not required in order to insure the health, safety and welfare of inhabitants of the development or the adjacent property.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(2)(c)">(c)</span> Increased Setbacks. Setbacks greater than those of the immediately adjacent property may be required where the intensity of development is greater than that of the adjacent property to such an extent that greater peripheral setbacks are needed in order to insure the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the development of the adjacent property.</p>
