                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> For one and two story multiple family dwellings on corner parcels, there shall be maintained a minimum side yard of not less than seven and one-half feet (7-1/2') on the side adjacent to the street which intersects the street upon which the building maintains frontage. In the case of a reversed corner parcel, there shall be maintained a setback from the side of not less than fifty percent (50%) of the front yard required on the parcels in the rear of such corner parcels but such setback need not exceed ten feet (10'). Accessory buildings on said reversed corner parcel shall not project beyond the front yard requirement on the adjacent parcel to the rear; nor be located nearer than six feet (6') to the side parcel line of said adjacent parcels. For multiple family dwelling structures of more than two (2) stories in height on corner parcels, the minimum required side yard shall be one-half (1/2) the height of the building to a maximum of twenty-five feet (25') unless a greater dimension is required as a condition of approval for special use permits.</p>

For those nonresidential structures of more than two stories in height, there shall be provided and maintained a side yard setback equal to one-half (1/2) the height of the building, or fifteen feet (15'), whichever is greater. Additional side yard setback may be required as part of the conditions of a special use permit. When a special use is proposed for a parcel which abuts an R1 or R2 zoned parcel, the provisions of subsection (e) shall apply.</p>
