                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The purpose of the CBD District is to encourage the development and re-use of existing downtown structures as a center for retail, cultural, entertainment, and community service uses. Pedestrian activity should be strongly encouraged at the ground floor level, while upper floor office and residential uses should be encouraged to promote active daytime and nighttime use of the downtown area. Amenities that will enhance the downtown environment for public and public oriented uses shall also be encouraged.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In order to insure that these purposes will be carried out, a basic set of regulations establishing maximum permitted floor area, building setback requirements, maximum height and bulk, minimum open space standards, and required retail ground floor uses have been set forth.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> For the areas in the required retail frontage area as designated by the Downtown Plan, it is intended that ground floor retail and service uses with windows be provided to maintain downtown's commercial vitality and continuity within the retail core. Uses within this area should enhance the pedestrian scale of the downtown core and allow for a compact walking environment in which all shopping opportunities are easily accessible. It is intended that all uses in this area maintain ground floor visibility to serve patrons on an unannounced or drop-in basis, conduct a majority of their business face-to-face on the premises with their customers, and maintain retail storefronts comparable to traditional retail sales operations, including display of goods and services for sale.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The Central Business District zoning district will be restricted to those properties within a parking assessment district. It is the intent of these regulations to insure the continued growth and development of the downtown area, thereby enabling it to remain an important retail, cultural, entertainment, business, financial, and medical center of the City and of mid-San Mateo County. Residential uses will be encouraged by increased housing densities in the downtown area in order to provide a wide range of housing opportunities for growing number of downtown employees, as well as existing residents.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> It is the intent of these regulations to encourage development of higher intensity than in other parts of City in order to create the concentration of development and activity appropriate to a major business center. Development intensities should vary by subarea to minimize impacts on adjacent areas, moderate transportation and parking requirements, preserve essential physical characteristics of the primary shopping area, conserve architectural, historical and natural values and make new residential development possible.</p>

              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p>To encourage development of large, vacant, underutilized parcels as designated in the Downtown Plan, exceptions from land use standards contained in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/">this title</a> may be granted upon approval of a downtown economic development permit by the City Council for properties in the Central Business District (CBD). Approval of such an application shall be based on the following findings:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The project is consistent with the goal statements of the Downtown Plan;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The project is of an excellent design quality and is consistent with the Downtown Retail Core and Downtown Historic District Design Guidelines;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The project is a significant development which presents a substantial economic development opportunity for the City and attempts to maximize use of the site;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The project has a minimum building floor area ratio of 1.0 (not including surface and structured parking) or includes a substantial public improvement such as a public parking garage, open space plaza, public marketplace or other public facility; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Any unmitigated significant impacts are outweighed by the project's economic, social or other benefits.</p>
