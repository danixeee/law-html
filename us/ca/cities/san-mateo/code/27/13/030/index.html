                <p>The City Council of the City of San Mateo declares that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Adequate transportation improvements are needed to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens to facilitate transportation, and to promote economic well-being within the City;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The City of San Mateo provides transportation improvements and services for residents, businesses, and employees within the City;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Individual transportation improvements are part of an integrated system serving and providing benefits to the entire City;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The Level of Service "D" (Average Delay of 45 seconds) shall be the interim standard for all street and intersection improvements pending adoption of the revised General Plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> New development within the City will create an additional burden on the existing transportation system;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Improvements to the existing transportation system in the City are needed to mitigate the cumulative impacts of new development and to accommodate future development by maintaining Level of Service "D" on all streets and intersections;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> All types of urban development require and use the transportation system;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> There are not adequate public funds available to maintain Level of Service "D" at all intersections in the City.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> In order to ensure that Level of Service "D" is maintained, and to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the community, it is necessary that new development pay a fee representing its share of costs of the necessary improvements;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> The transportation improvement fee is based upon the evidence that new development generates additional residents, employees, and structures which in turn place an additional cumulative burden upon the local transportation system and should be expected to pay a share of the new facilities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span> The purpose of this fee is to help provide adequate transportation improvements to serve cumulative development within the City. However, the fee does not replace the need for all site-specific transportation improvements that may be needed to mitigate the impact of specific projects upon the City's transportation system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> The transportation improvements for which the fee will be used are identified in the City's Capital Improvements Program (CIP) and/or in the Transportation Improvement Fee Technical Report.</p>
