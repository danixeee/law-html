                <p>The Council finds that the community's standard of care and maintenance of real property in the City is significantly higher than the standard established by Titles <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7/">7</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/10/">10</a> of this code for creation of a public nuisance. It is, therefore, a matter of public concern when a site for an approved development is allowed to deteriorate for a period of time before construction begins even if it does not become a public nuisance under this code. <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/68/">This chapter</a> is intended to provide the enforcement power to compel and the incentive otherwise lacking for the owner and the project developer to maintain the property at a level consistent with the neighboring properties and its condition at the time of the project approval. These measures are needed to prevent unnecessary loss of tax revenues and park in-lieu fees caused by the depreciating effect of the site's condition, to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the City, and to safeguard the aesthetic standards of the community.</p>

The Commission shall permit testimony from the public at the hearing.</p>
