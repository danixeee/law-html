                <p>Senior citizen housing may be permitted as a special use in SC overlay district, when the proposed use meets all of the following criteria:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Residential occupancy shall be limited to senior citizens 62 years of age or older, or 55 years of age or older in a senior citizen housing development, and qualified permanent residents, all as defined in California Civil Code Sections <a class="internal-link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=51.2&amp;lawCode=CIV">51.2</a>-<a class="internal-link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=51.4&amp;lawCode=CIV">51.4</a>, or any successor legislation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> The impact of the use will be substantially equivalent to those impacts produced by uses otherwise allowed for land within the underlying classification of the zoning plot, with considerations being given to the type of the living units, number of living units, the probable number of residents and the demand on public facilities and services generated.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> The location, size, design, and operating characteristics of the use will be compatible with and will not adversely affect the livability or appropriate development of abutting properties and the surrounding neighborhood, with consideration to be given to harmony in scale, bulk, coverage, and density; to the availability of civic facilities and utilities; to harmful effect, if any, upon desirable neighborhood character; to the generation of traffic and the capacity of surrounding streets; and to any other relevant impacts of the use.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> The location, design, and site planning of the use will provide a convenient and functional living, working, shopping, or civic environment, and will be attractive as the nature of the use and its location and setting warrant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> The use will enhance the successful operation of the surrounding area in its basic community function, or will provide an essential service to the community or region.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(6)">(6)</span> Housing shall be specifically designed for the elderly and include facilities generally associated with the needs and interests of aged persons. Such facilities shall include common meeting and recreation facilities, secure parking areas, safety bars and rails in units, emergency signal system, adequate exterior lighting for security, ramps and other provisions required for elderly persons by State law or federal regulation. In addition, such facilities may include central dining facilities, laundry rooms, other convenience facilities for occupants, meeting and activity facilities for use by senior citizens from the surrounding community, and other facilities for the convenience of the senior residents.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(7)">(7)</span> The use will be so located as to provide residents easy access to community services such as transportation, shopping, and other daily services. Where appropriate, there should also be provided a generous amount of activity facilities (both indoors and outdoors) for residents.</p>
