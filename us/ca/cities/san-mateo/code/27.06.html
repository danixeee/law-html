                <p>The Council may adopt by resolution from time to time a developer's contribution policy to be applied in zoning and land-use administration. New or changed developments often place an increased demand upon public facilities. When additional, new, or expanded public improvements are needed to support a new or changed land use or development, these improvements should be paid for on an equitable basis by the developer. New land-use projects should not require the expenditure of tax moneys to support the project development. The required improvements should be compatible and in continuity with adjacent, or tributary, public improvements. The land use or development, its users and the public, should receive legitimate benefits from the construction of new or upgraded public facilities.</p>
