                <p>It is the policy of the City of San Mateo to provide persons with disabilities reasonable accommodation in regulations and procedures to ensure equal access to housing, and to facilitate the development of housing for persons with disabilities. <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27.79" title="Chapter 27.79 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR RESIDENTIAL USES">This chapter</a> is based on requirements of Federal and State housing laws, including the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act, the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, and implements the housing element of the City's General Plan.</p>
                <p>The purpose of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27.79" title="Chapter 27.79 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR RESIDENTIAL USES">this chapter</a> is to provide a procedure under which a person with disabilities may request a reasonable accommodation in the application of zoning regulations in order to secure equal access to housing, and outlines a process for decision makers to act upon such requests. <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27.79" title="Chapter 27.79 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR RESIDENTIAL USES">This chapter</a> is intended solely for residential use and is distinct from the requirements for a variance.</p>
                <p>The City also recognizes the importance of sustaining and enhancing residential neighborhoods, as articulated in the City's General Plan, and will consider whether the requested reasonable accommodation would result in an undue burden to the City or a fundamental alteration of City policies.</p>
