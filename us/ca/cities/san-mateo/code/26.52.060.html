                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> A complete and accurate survey of the land to be subdivided shall be made by a civil engineer or licensed land surveyor in accordance with the standard practices and principles of land surveying.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The traverse of the exterior boundaries of the tract, and of each block when computed from field measurement of the ground, must close within an error limit of one foot to ten thousand feet of perimeter for balancing the survey.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Whenever the City engineer has established a system of coordinates, then the survey shall be tied into such system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> All monuments, property lines, centerlines of streets, paths and easements adjoining or within such tracts shall be tied into the survey.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Monuments:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> In making the survey of the subdivision, the surveyors shall set sufficient permanent monuments so that the survey, or any part thereof may be readily retraced. Such monuments shall be set along the exterior boundaries of the subdivision at intervals not exceeding five hundred feet and shall be placed at the angle points on the exterior boundary lines of the tract, at the intersections to the centerlines of the streets, and at the beginnings and ends of curves at centerlines of streets and at such other points as may be required by the City engineer. Monuments may be placed on offset lines. Due consideration shall be given to visibility of monuments one from another. The monuments in the street area shall be set so that the tops are at least seven and one-half inches below the top of the finished pavement, and enclosed in cast-iron receptacles, with cast covers of a type and marking acceptable to the City engineer, set flush to the top of the finished pavement and supported independently of the monument. Monuments in other locations should not be placed until all grading is complete, and then not be set less than eight inches below the finished grade, unless otherwise directed by the City engineer;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> Monuments and benchmarks may be set after approval of the final map, but not later than the time of completion of the subdivision improvements if at the time of the approval of the final map, the responsible civil engineer or land surveyor has provided the Council with security adequate to ensure that the costs of setting the monuments and benchmarks shall be paid and naming the City as beneficiary of the security. However, in every instance and prior to the approval of the final map the civil engineer or land surveyor shall adequately monument or reference at least one exterior boundary line;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> Monuments shall be either: galvanized iron pipe, not less than two inches in diameter, and thirty-six inches long; or, reinforced concrete posts six inches by six inches in cross section and six inches in diameter, and thirty inches long, or an equally durable alternative when approved by the City engineer. All monuments shall have a copper plate or disk securely attached to the top of the monument with a copper dowel or copper nail set in concrete or approved alternate device permanently marking the exact center. All monuments shall be set in approved monument boxes with covers upon which the words "Survey Monument" are engrossed in raised letters. The registration or license number of the engineer or surveyor shall be stamped on the copper plate or disk;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> Permanent elevation benchmark, of a type approved by the City engineer and referring to the City datum or mean sea level datum as established by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, shall be set in the amount and location satisfactory to the City engineer;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(5)">(5)</span> Any monument or benchmark, required by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26" title="Title 26 SUBDIVISIONS">this title</a>, which is disturbed or destroyed before the acceptance of all improvements, shall be replaced by the subdivider.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Lot Corner and Angle Point Markers. Galvanized iron pipe or pin, not less than one inch in diameter and twenty-four inches long, shall be driven flush with the surface of the ground at each lot corner, angle point and curve point where no monument is set. The registration or license number of the engineer or surveyor shall be stamped on an approved metal tag which shall be affixed to such markers. Any lot corner or angle point marker disturbed or destroyed before acceptance of all improvements shall be replaced by the subdivider.</p>
