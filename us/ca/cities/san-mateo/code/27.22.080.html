In the case of a reversed corner parcel, there shall be maintained a setback from the side of not less than fifty percent (50%) of the front yard required on the parcels in the rear of such corner parcels but such setback need not exceed ten feet (10'). Accessory buildings on said reversed corner parcel shall not project beyond the front yard requirement on the adjacent parcel to the rear; nor be located nearer than six feet (6') to the side parcel line of said adjacent parcels. For multiple family dwelling structures of more than two (2) stories in height on corner parcels, the minimum required side yard shall be one-half (1/2) the height of the building to a maximum of twenty-five feet (25') unless a greater dimension is required as a condition of approval for special use permits.</p>

Additional side yard setback may be required as part of the conditions of a special use permit.
