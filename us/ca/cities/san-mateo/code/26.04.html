The number of intersections on thoroughfares shall be kept to a minimum consistent with the basic needs of ingress and egress. Intersections shall be so designed as to provide optimum safety for pedestrians and motorists and other users of the streets. Provisions shall be made for assuring adequate light, air and privacy on all parcels of property regardless of the land use. Topography and vegetation of exceptional character shall be respected, and streets shall be designed so as to prevent excessive grading and scarring of the landscape. Special care shall be taken in the design and construction to provide stable soil and subsoil conditions. Problems of drainage shall be resolved in such manner as to provide substantial security against excessive runoff or flooding, earth movements and excessive erosion.</p>
