No percentage shall be paid for the first five years succeeding the date of the franchise, but thereafter such percentage shall be payable annually; and in the event such payment is not made, such franchise shall be forfeited; provided, further, that if the franchise is a renewal of a right already in existence, the payment of such percentage of gross receipts shall begin at once.</p>
