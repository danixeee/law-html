                <p>For the purposes of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/54/">this chapter</a>, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> "BOD" means biochemical oxygen demand. It is a measure of the oxygen used by microorganisms to decompose waste. The larger the quantity of organic waste in the water supply, the greater the demand for oxygen due to greater bacteria so the BOD level will be high.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> "Commercial" means all uses other than residential.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> "Connection" means each separate residential, lodging, or commercial and industrial, and institutional unit connected to an internal plumbing drainage system or external sewer lateral.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> "Customer class" means or represents the structure or designation by which a user is classified based on industry wastewater standards for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS). There are five customer classes, one for residential and four for commercial customers. Customer classes are further defined as shown below.</p>
                <p>	Class A – Standard Strength. All residential users including, but not limited to, single-family dwelling units, duplex units, and multi-family dwelling units.</p>
                <p>	Class B – Standard Strength. Commercial users, including, but not limited to, offices, retail establishments, hotel and motels without restaurants, mixed uses (high strength comprises &lt; 25% of flow).</p>
                <p>	Class C – Moderate Strength. Commercial users, including, but not limited to, hotels and motels with restaurants, industrial laundries, mixed use (high strength comprises 25% to 75% of flow), supermarkets with food preparation, bakeries, meat or seafood counters.</p>
                <p>	Class D – High Strength. Commercial users, including, but not limited to, restaurants, wholesale bakeries, mortuaries, mixed use (high strength comprises &gt;75% of flow).</p>
                <p>	Class E – Special. Commercial users that may require a determination on a case by case basis as prescribed by <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/54/030/#(e)">Section 3.54.030(e)</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> "Director of Public Work" means Director of Public Works or designee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> "Fixture unit" means a unit of measurement for computing waste flow volumes for each plumbing fixture as set forth in the Uniform Plumbing Code as then adopted by the City in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/">Title 23</a> of this code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> "Inordinately high" means usage in one month that exceeds usage by 150% of the five months of average usage. An example follows. Usage for November is 37, December is 76, January is 20, February is 16, and March is 17. The five month average is 33.20. Usage in any one month in excess of 49.8 (i.e., 150% of 33.2) would be considered inordinately high. Therefore December would be found to be inordinately high and dropped from the calculation as required in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/54/030/">Section 3.54.030</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> "Institutional" means uses by churches, clubs, hospitals, lodges, community care facilities, schools, and public buildings, whether privately or publicly owned, and whether profit or nonprofit in operation. Such entities shall be considered commercial.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> "Residential" means a place designed or used for residence or dwelling, whether permanent or temporary in nature. Residential does not include hotels or motels.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> "Restaurant" means restaurant, fast-food, and drive-in establishments, as defined in the Zoning Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span> "SS" means suspended solids. They are the solids which can be removed from the wastewater by physical or mechanical means, such as sedimentation or filtration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> "Strength" means the level of BOD and SS in the wastewater.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(m)">(m)</span> "User" means any person or persons, a legal entity, or a business, commercial or manufacturing enterprise, which uses the sewer system and disposal facilities of the City in any manner, and whether a property owner or tenant.</p>
