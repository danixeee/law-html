                <p>Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/">this chapter</a>:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> "Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portions thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/">this chapter</a> and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/">this chapter</a> by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> "Tax Collector" means the City's Finance Director or designee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right-of-access, license or other agreement for a period of 30 consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/">this chapter</a> may be considered.</p>
