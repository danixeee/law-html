Where the operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/">this chapter</a> and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/">this chapter</a> by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> "Tax Collector" means the City's Finance Director or designee.</p>

Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/">this chapter</a> may be considered.</p>

                <p>For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a general tax in the amount of 10% of the rent charged by the operator.

The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Collector may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Collector.</p>

                <p>If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/">this chapter</a>, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/">this chapter</a>, the Tax Collector shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Collector procures such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/">this chapter</a> and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the Tax Collector shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/">this chapter</a>. In case such determination is made, the Tax Collector shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of address. Such operator may within 10 days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax Collector for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Collector, shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Collector shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Collector shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3/56/130/">Section 3.56.130</a>.</p>
