                <p>Prior to submittal of the annual budget, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council the fees proposed for the next fiscal year. The prior year's fees shall continue if the City Manager does not submit new proposed fees. If the proposed fees do not represent a percentage increase exceeding the percentage increase for the preceding twelve (12) month period as shown by the San Francisco Bay Area Consumer Price Index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor, under the heading All Items, or any index substituted by the Department of Labor therefor, the proposed fees shall become effective on the following July 1, unless a different date is set forth in the submission, provided however that the Council may amend the fees before the effective date. If the proposed fees represent a percentage increase exceeding the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, they must be approved by the Council before becoming effective. Notwithstanding the above, the Council may amend any fee at any time.</p>
