                <p>Upon receiving the final map from the subdivider or his or her agent, the City engineer shall transmit one complete map to the director of community development who shall examine the map to determine whether it conforms to the tentative map and with all the changes and requirements imposed as a condition of the approval of the tentative map. If it is determined that the final map does not so conform, the subdivider shall be advised of the changes and additions that must be made before the final map can be approved. If it is determined that the map does so conform, the director of community development shall so note on the map and return the copy of the map to the City engineer.</p>
                <p>Upon receipt of the copy of the map from the director of community development, the City engineer shall review the final map for:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Sufficiency of affidavits and acknowledgements;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> Correctness of the survey data, mathematical data, and computations; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> Sufficiency and adequacy of public utility easements as evidenced by certifications by the affected public utilities or private agencies.</p>
                <p>One copy of the final map shall be returned to the subdivider with either:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(a)">(a)</span> Notations as to errors or omissions, and the subdivider shall correct the map before refiling it; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(3)(b)">(b)</span> A statement by the City Engineer that the final map is correct. The subdivider shall then submit the original tracings on polyester base film or comparable process and a complete set of blueline prints on cloth with original signatures on both tracings and prints to the City Engineer for transmittal to the Director of Community Development.</p>
                <p>If the final map is found to be correct, the data shown thereon and submitted therewith are sufficient, and all applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26/">this Title</a> have been complied with, the City Engineer will, within twenty (20) days from the time the corrected final map is submitted to him or her by the subdivider, certify his or her approval on the original tracing and the blueline cloth print of the map and deliver it to the Director of Community Development. The Director of Community Development shall then certify its conformance to the tentative map and file it and the related documents with the City Clerk.</p>
