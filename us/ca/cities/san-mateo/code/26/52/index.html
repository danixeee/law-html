                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> In making the survey of the subdivision, the surveyors shall set sufficient permanent monuments so that the survey, or any part thereof may be readily retraced. Such monuments shall be set along the exterior boundaries of the subdivision at intervals not exceeding five hundred feet and shall be placed at the angle points on the exterior boundary lines of the tract, at the intersections to the centerlines of the streets, and at the beginnings and ends of curves at centerlines of streets and at such other points as may be required by the City engineer. Monuments may be placed on offset lines. Due consideration shall be given to visibility of monuments one from another. The monuments in the street area shall be set so that the tops are at least seven and one-half inches below the top of the finished pavement, and enclosed in cast-iron receptacles, with cast covers of a type and marking acceptable to the City engineer, set flush to the top of the finished pavement and supported independently of the monument. Monuments in other locations should not be placed until all grading is complete, and then not be set less than eight inches below the finished grade, unless otherwise directed by the City engineer;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> Monuments and benchmarks may be set after approval of the final map, but not later than the time of completion of the subdivision improvements if at the time of the approval of the final map, the responsible civil engineer or land surveyor has provided the Council with security adequate to ensure that the costs of setting the monuments and benchmarks shall be paid and naming the City as beneficiary of the security. However, in every instance and prior to the approval of the final map the civil engineer or land surveyor shall adequately monument or reference at least one exterior boundary line;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> Monuments shall be either: galvanized iron pipe, not less than two inches in diameter, and thirty-six inches long; or, reinforced concrete posts six inches by six inches in cross section and six inches in diameter, and thirty inches long, or an equally durable alternative when approved by the City engineer. All monuments shall have a copper plate or disk securely attached to the top of the monument with a copper dowel or copper nail set in concrete or approved alternate device permanently marking the exact center. All monuments shall be set in approved monument boxes with covers upon which the words "Survey Monument" are engrossed in raised letters. The registration or license number of the engineer or surveyor shall be stamped on the copper plate or disk;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> Permanent elevation benchmark, of a type approved by the City engineer and referring to the City datum or mean sea level datum as established by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, shall be set in the amount and location satisfactory to the City engineer;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Lot Corner and Angle Point Markers. Galvanized iron pipe or pin, not less than one inch in diameter and twenty-four inches long, shall be driven flush with the surface of the ground at each lot corner, angle point and curve point where no monument is set.

                <p>Upon receiving the final map from the subdivider or his or her agent, the City engineer shall transmit one complete map to the director of community development who shall examine the map to determine whether it conforms to the tentative map and with all the changes and requirements imposed as a condition of the approval of the tentative map. If it is determined that the final map does not so conform, the subdivider shall be advised of the changes and additions that must be made before the final map can be approved. If it is determined that the map does so conform, the director of community development shall so note on the map and return the copy of the map to the City engineer.</p>
                <p>Upon receipt of the copy of the map from the director of community development, the City engineer shall review the final map for:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Sufficiency of affidavits and acknowledgements;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> Correctness of the survey data, mathematical data, and computations; and</p>

                <p>If the final map is found to be correct, the data shown thereon and submitted therewith are sufficient, and all applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26/">this Title</a> have been complied with, the City Engineer will, within twenty (20) days from the time the corrected final map is submitted to him or her by the subdivider, certify his or her approval on the original tracing and the blueline cloth print of the map and deliver it to the Director of Community Development.

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Filing. Upon receipt of the final map and related documents, the City Clerk will put the matter on an agenda of a regular Council meeting for acceptance and filing that is no more than fifteen (15) days after the filing of the final subdivision map with the City Clerk.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Agreements. In the event that the improvements required under <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26/">this Title</a> have not been installed to the satisfaction of the City Engineer at the time of the filing of the final map for any or all of the portions of a proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall file with the City Clerk at the time of filing the final map with the City Clerk an executed agreement between the subdivider and the City specifying the period within which the subdivider shall complete all improvements and work to the satisfaction of the City. The agreement shall also prescribe that the subdivider shall repair any damage to public roads, streets, and any other public property or improvements that results from, or is incidental to, the construction of the improvements in the subdivision, or in lieu of making such repairs, the subdivider shall pay to the owner of the damaged property or improvements the full cost of repair and restoration.</p>
                <p>Such an agreement shall also include a performance bond or other improvement security, a labor and materials bond and evidence of insurance coverage for public liability, property damage, and workers compensation in the form and in the amounts generally required of all agreements for public improvements entered into by the City.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions. At the time of filing the final map with the City Clerk, the subdivider shall also provide the City Clerk with verification that any conditions, covenants, and restrictions to be recorded with the final map have been reviewed by the City Attorney for conformance with City approval conditions, when such conditions expressly require review by the City Attorney.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Council Action. The Council shall take action on the final map at either the meeting before which the Clerk has placed the matter or the next regular Council meeting. The Council will approve the map if it conforms to the tentative map and all applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26/">this Title</a>. The time limit for action may be extended by mutual agreement of the City and the subdivider. Concurrently with the approval of the final map, the Council will accept or reject such offers of dedication as it deems advisable, and as a condition precedent to the acceptance of any property interests, shall require the subdivider to either improve or agree in writing to improve such interests in the subdivision.</p>
