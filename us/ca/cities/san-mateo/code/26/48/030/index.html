If the application is complete, the Zoning Administrator shall report the same to the subdivider or applicant in writing within thirty days of its receipt, specifying those parts of the application which are incomplete and indicating the manner in which they can be made complete. If the written determination is not made within thirty days of receipt, the application shall be deemed complete. Once an application is complete, or deemed complete, no new information shall be required of the applicant which was not specified on the compiled lists at the time the application is complete or deemed complete, unless it is to clarify, amplify the information submitted, or needed to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act.</p>
                <p>The date an application is determined or deemed to be complete shall begin the period for review under the California Environmental Quality Act. It shall also vest relocation rights in the tenants then residing on the project site who will be displaced by it and who have not given voluntary notice of termination.</p>
                <p>The subdivider shall provide such additional prints of the documents and map as are necessary for environmental and planning review by the City and one reproducible copy thereof.</p>
