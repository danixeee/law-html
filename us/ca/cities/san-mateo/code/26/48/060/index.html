                <p>On the date set for formal review of the tentative map, the Planning Commission shall review the comments and the opinions of the subdivider and of his or her engineer, and any other officers, agencies, utilities, and environmental consultants that have submitted a report. After giving due consideration to all such reports, recommendations, comments and opinions, the Commission shall approve or deny the tentative map.</p>
                <p>The Commission shall deny approval of a tentative map if it makes any of the following findings:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans.</p>

In this connection, the governing body may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements, for access or for use, will be provided, and that these will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and no authority is hereby granted to a legislative body to determine that the public at large has acquired easements for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision.</p>
