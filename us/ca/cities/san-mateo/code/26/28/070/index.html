                <p>The street pattern in the subdivision shall be in conformity with the general plan, and shall provide for the development of adjoining areas and the entire planning area or district. The following principles and standards shall be observed:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(1)">(1)</span> Where appropriate in the design, proposed major arterials and collectors shall be continuous and in alignment with existing planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. The centerlines of connecting or intersecting streets not in alignment shall be offset to midblock or at least as specified in the design standards and specifications;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(2)">(2)</span> Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the land to be divided in all cases where it is determined such extension is necessary for traffic circulation and coordination of the layout of the proposed subdivision with existing development, or the advantageous future development of adjacent property;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(3)">(3)</span> The maximum length of culs-de-sac shall be related to the nature of adjacent land use, but shall not exceed the length specified in the design standards and specifications, and they shall terminate in a circle with a diameter satisfactory to the City engineer. Other turning patterns may be approved on recommendation of the City engineer if, in his or her opinion, the nature of the topography necessitates, or can accommodate, such modified design;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(4)">(4)</span> In the case of stubend streets extending to the boundary of the property, the entire street shall not be dedicated, but a one foot strip the width of the right-of-way shall be deeded to the City at the end of the stub-end street. Improvement of the strip shall be suspended and a barrier erected, pending the extension of said street into adjacent property. Where required, a temporary turnaround or a temporary connection to another street shall be provided within a public right-of-way by the subdivider;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(5)">(5)</span> Proposed streets shall intersect one another at approximately ninety degrees but in no event more than fifteen degrees off ninety degrees where topography, other limiting factors, or good traffic design indicate the desirability of modifying this rule;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(6)">(6)</span> The corners of both curbs and property lines shall be rounded as indicated in the design standards and specifications. Where necessitated by traffic safety considerations, greater corner radii may be required;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(7)">(7)</span> Excessively long, straight residential streets, conducive to high-speed traffic, requiring steep grades, and/or requiring excessive grading, shall be avoided.</p>
