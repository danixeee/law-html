                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> A scale drawing, showing the existing and proposed lot or parcel lines, lot and tract numbers, and location of existing improvements, easements, and reservations, if any, shall be prepared by licensed land surveyor or registered civil engineer licensed by the State to perform such work and filed accompanied by any required fees with the City Engineer;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The City Engineer shall review this drawing for conformity with <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26/">this Title</a> and all other applicable provisions of this Code. The proposed adjustment shall not be approved if any public utility easements or rights-of-way will be adversely affected without the consent of the affected utilities or agencies. The City Engineer shall also consider whether the proposed adjustment will adversely affect access to any affected parcel and condition the adjustment to ensure that access is adequately preserved. When the City Engineer is satisfied that the drawing, as it may be corrected by the applicant, meets the applicable requirements of this Code, the City Engineer will indicate his or her approval or conditional approval on the drawing and forward the drawing to the Director of Community Development.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The Director of Community Development will then review the drawing for conformity with all other applicable provisions of this code. The Director of Community Development may either approve, disapprove, or conditionally approve the proposed adjustment. He or she shall so indicate on the drawing and shall send it to the City Engineer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> If the proposed adjustment is approved, or conditionally approved, the applicant shall then meet with the City Engineer or his or her designee to determine the scope and standards of survey, if any, to be used and shall then submit the following documentation to the City Engineer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)(i)">(i)</span> Executed deeds with a written legal description of each area to be transferred, if more than one property owner is involved;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)(ii)">(ii)</span> A written legal description of the new parcels to be created by the adjustment;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)">(6)</span> The City Engineer will review the materials submitted, and if they meet with his or her approval, he or she will approve them by signing the certificate and forward them to the Director of Community Development.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(7)">(7)</span> The Director of Community Development will then review the materials submitted, and if they meet with his or her approval, he or she will approve them by signing the certificate and return them to the City Engineer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(8)">(8)</span> The City Engineer shall then cause the lot line adjustment to be recorded with the County Recorder. The applicants shall pay all costs of delivery and recordation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Instead of following the procedures contained in Subsection (a) above, an applicant may voluntarily follow the procedures of filing a parcel map as modified by this Subsection:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> A scale drawing showing the existing and proposed lot or parcel lines, lot and tract numbers, and location of existing improvements, easements, and reservations, if any, shall be prepared and filed with the City Engineer;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> Approval of the drawing as described above shall satisfy any requirement for a tentative parcel map pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26/56/">Chapter 26.56</a>. If the drawing is approved or conditionally approved by the Director of Community Development, the applicant shall then submit the final parcel map with the required checklist and fee to the City Engineer for processing as follows. No tentative parcel map will be required.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> The City Engineer shall then review and process the final parcel map pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26/56/">Chapter 26.56</a> of this Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> A final decision of the Director of Community Development or the City Engineer under this Section may be appealed to the Planning Commission pursuant to Section 27.08.070(a).</p>
