                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> In order properly to serve the subdivision, two acres are needed for each 1,000 estimated population as determined by applying factors per dwelling structure types as outlined in the City's fee schedule in effect at the time the fees are to be paid.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The fair market value of land in the City, used to calculate each subdivider's in-lieu fee and determined by the Parks and Recreation Director or designee, will be included in the City's fee schedule adopted by City Council resolution. For purposes of determining the in-lieu fee, the Parks and Recreation Director or designee may require that a subdivider submit available sales information regarding the site subject to development and, alternatively, a subdivider-paid appraisal of the site subject to development if accurate sales information is not available prior to the approval of the first final map.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Only the payment of fees is required in subdivisions of 50 parcels or less.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> Subdivisions containing fewer than five parcels and not used for residential purposes are exempt from the requirements of this section; provided, however, that a condition may be placed on the approval of such parcel map that if a building permit is requested for construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more parcels within four years the fee must be required to be paid by the owner of each such parcel as a condition to the issuance of such permit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> If the subdivider provides park and recreational improvements to the dedicated land, the value of the improvements together with any equipment located thereon shall be a credit against the payment of fees or dedication of land required by <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26/64/">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Fees shall be paid at or before the time of issuance of the first building permit for a development project.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Partial Credit Available. Where private park and recreational facility space is provided in a development and such space is held in common ownership and is to be privately owned and maintained, partial credit, not to exceed a maximum of 50%, may be allowed against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees in-lieu thereof.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Requirements. Credits may be given for facilities included on the list of private park and recreation facilities approved for credit by resolution of the City Council. Facilities that fall within two or more of the classifications set forth in the resolution will be placed in the category that best fits the potential use of the facility. There will be no double credits for facilities. In order for private park and recreational facilities to be eligible for credit, the Parks and Recreation Director or designee must determine that it is in the public interest to do so, that the proposed private park and recreational facilities and their design and location are appropriate for the proposed development and all of the following requirements are met:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> The proposed private park and recreational facility space equals at least 25% of the acreage of the total parkland dedication requirement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> The proposed private park and recreational facility space is not located in a private yard or required setback.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> A minimum of 25 feet separates all park and recreational facilities from residential units, private patios and parking lots, unless the Zoning Administrator, in consultation with the Director of Parks and Recreation or designee, determines that there is no substantial impact upon neighboring residents or the facilities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> The continued private ownership and maintenance of approved park and recreation facilities is documented by recorded agreement, conveyance, or restrictions subject to the review and approval of the City Attorney.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> Park and recreational facilities are restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant, which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of property and cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the City.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(6)">(6)</span> The proposed park and recreational facilities are suitable for use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(7)">(7)</span> The proposed for park and recreational facilities comply with the Conservation, Open Space and Park and Recreation Element of the General Plan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)">(8)</span> The proposed park and recreation facilities provide, except as noted otherwise herein, a mix of park and recreational elements consisting of no less than three of the facility types approved by City Council resolution, or a combination of such other recreational facilities, approved by the Parks and Recreation Director or designee, that will meet the park and recreational needs of the future residents of the area. Projects whose required land dedication space is 14,000 square feet or less may provide fewer than three main facility types and will receive the up to the following maximum credits:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)(A)">(A)</span> Projects with a land dedication space requirement of 8,000 square feet up to and including 14,000 square feet:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)(A)(i)">(i)</span> No credit for one facility type.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)(A)(ii)">(ii)</span> 35% maximum credit for two facility types.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)(A)(iii)">(iii)</span> 50% maximum credit for three facility types.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)(B)">(B)</span> Projects with a land dedication space requirement of less than 8,000 square feet:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)(B)(i)">(i)</span> 20% maximum credit for one facility type.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)(B)(ii)">(ii)</span> 35% maximum credit for two facility types.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)(B)(iii)">(iii)</span> 50% maximum credit for three facility types.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Calculation. Private Park and Recreational Facility Space credit is calculated by first dividing the cumulated park and recreation facility space that qualifies for credit by the total park land dedication requirement and then by multiplying this result by the maximum credit allowable. For example:</p>
                <p>If the cumulated amount of Park and Recreational Facility Space that qualifies for credit = 5,000 square feet (SF), and</p>
                <p>Park land dedication requirement = 15,000 SF, and</p>
                <p>The maximum allowable credit = 50%, then:</p>
                <p>5,000 SF / 15,000 SF = .333</p>
                <p>Therefore .333 x 50% max = 16.65% credit for project off of the fee.</p>
