Design of any street or driveway shall demonstrate consideration of such factors as surrounding topography, drainage, pedestrian access, the presence of intersections, driveways, and/or bicycle lanes, vehicular volume and type, and vehicular operation. The flattest grade that reasonably fits the topography should be used and appropriate transitions (vertical curves) between changes in grade are required.</p>

Any pipe trench or other trenching or excavation made in any slope of an excavated or filled site shall be backfilled to the level of the surrounding grade. Such backfill shall be compacted to the original density of the excavated materials, but in no case less than ninety (90%) percent of the maximum density achieved by an AASHO soil compaction test method, selected by the City Engineer. Suitable check drains to control erosion shall be installed as directed by the City Engineer.</p>

All cut and fill surfaces created by a grading process, agricultural processes excepted, shall be planted with a ground cover that is acceptable to a soils engineer and compatible with ground covers in general use in the area, and is one that will thrive with little or no maintenance once established. Topsoils are to be stockpiled during rough grading and used on cut and fill slopes to a depth sufficient to support the proposed plant materials in a manner acceptable to a soils engineer. On slopes likely to be extensively disturbed by later construction, an interim ground cover may be planted or emplaced to be supplemented by the permanent ground cover and/or shrubs and trees when the site is finally developed and landscaped. When slopes have been permitted too steep to support continuous ground cover, and in lieu thereof niches and ledges have been provided for planting, such slopes need not be planted with a continuous ground cover, but may instead be screened with vines and plantings. Cuts and fills along public roads may be required to be landscaped and graded so as to blend into the natural surroundings. All plant materials shall be satisfactory to the superintendent of parks and/or City Engineer.</p>

"Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to, specifying a flatter exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, or implementation of other relevant BMPs: and reports of a registered soils engineer and/or of a registered engineering geologist whose recommendations may be made requirements for further work.</p>

On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail, the City Engineer may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion, or may require that the operation be conducted in specific stages so as to insure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.</p>
