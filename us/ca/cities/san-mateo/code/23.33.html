In examining this requirement, the City will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates or may purchase the property with knowledge that it is within the special flood hazard area.</p>

Alternate design standards may be approved for new construction or, substantial improvements necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.33" title="Chapter 23.33 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT">this chapter</a> are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood, does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. The alternate design standard criteria set forth in this section pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. An alternate design standard may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.33" title="Chapter 23.33 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT">this chapter</a> would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.</p>
                <p>Initial determination regarding issuance of a permit based upon alternate design standards shall be by the Floodplain Administrator.</p>

"Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.33" title="Chapter 23.33 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT">this chapter</a>. For example, in the case of alternate design standards to an elevation requirement, this means the City need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.33" title="Chapter 23.33 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT">this chapter</a>.</p>
