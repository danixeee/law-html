The standards and procedures contained in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">this Chapter</a> are intended to, and should be applied to, protect and promote public health, safety and welfare, and also balance the benefits that flow from robust, advanced wireless services with the City's local values, which include without limitation the aesthetic character of the City, its neighborhoods and community. <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10" title="Chapter 17.10 WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY">This Chapter</a> is also intended to reflect and promote the community interest by (1) ensuring that the balance between public and private interest is maintained on a case-by-case basis; (2) protecting the City's visual character from potential adverse impacts or visual blight created or exacerbated by wireless communications infrastructure; (3) protecting and preserving the City's environmental resources; and (4) promoting access to high-quality, advanced wireless services for the City's residents, businesses and visitors.</p>
