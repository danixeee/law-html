                <p>The workers' compensation fund is established and shall be maintained for the deposit of all moneys budgeted for payment of workers' compensation claims under the City's self-insurance program. It shall also be the depository for temporary disability and medical payments recovered from third parties or received while the employee is disabled and is receiving full salary under the provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=4850&amp;lawCode=LAB" title="">California Labor Code Section 4850</a> or the City personnel laws and rules.

All earnings from investments of the fund and all state-mandated benefit costs recovered shall also accrue to the fund. Such earnings shall be credited to the fund at least once annually before the close of the fiscal year.</p>
