All installations made in a public street, alley, or place shall be subject to the inspection of, and approval by, the City Engineer and subject to the conditions of an encroachment permit issued therefor. Whenever fire protection facilities, including but not limited to water mains and hydrant fixture, as required herein have been installed, extended, enlarged or expanded and any portion of the costs of which have been advanced by the City, a charge shall be collected prior to the issuance of a building permit for any building or structure on any parcel, unit, lot or part of any property served by fire protection facilities, which charge shall be computed by the City Engineer in an equitable manner so as to relate benefit received from said facilities to the actual cost thereof.</p>
