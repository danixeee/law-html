                <p>Appointments to vacant positions in the competitive service shall be made in accordance with the personnel rules.

The probationary period shall be considered an extension of the examination process. Physical and medical tests may be given as a part of any examination.</p>
                <p>In any examination the Personnel Officer may include, in addition to competitive tests, a qualifying test or tests, and set minimum standards therefor.</p>
                <p>Appointments shall be made by the City Council, or by the officer in whom the power to make appointments is vested.</p>
                <p>When appointment is to be made to a vacancy in the competitive service, the Personnel Officer shall transmit to the appointing power the names of all persons on the appropriate certified employment list, in the order in which they appear on the list.</p>
