                <p>A Residential Parking Permit Program is hereby approved and authorized for use in all residential districts or appurtenant to any authorized residential use. The excessive parking of nonresident vehicles on residential streets is detrimental to the integrity of the residential neighborhood. The purpose of this section is to avoid such detriment and allow residents to park upon streets in their own neighborhoods. The Director of Public Works is authorized to propose policies and procedures implementing a Residential Parking Permit Program. Those policies and procedures shall be reviewed by the Public Works Commission who shall thereafter make recommendations to the City Council for adoption. Such policies and procedures shall be consistent with the purpose of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/11/32/">this chapter</a>. Violations of the Residential Parking Permit Program Policies and Procedures are enforceable in the same manner and to the same extent as are violations of the other provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/11/">this title</a>.</p>
