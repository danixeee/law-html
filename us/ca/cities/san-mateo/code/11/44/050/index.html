If such vehicle remains parked in any such parking space beyond the parking time limit fixed for such parking space, the parking meter shall indicate such illegal parking and in that event, such vehicle shall be considered as parked overtime, and beyond the period of legal parking time, and the parking of a vehicle overtime or beyond the period of legal parking time in any such part of a street where any such meter is located is a violation of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/11/44/">this chapter</a> and punishable as hereinafter set out.</p>
