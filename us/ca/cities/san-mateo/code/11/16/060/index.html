Any person may appeal a decision of the Public Works Director made under <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/11/16/050/#(a)">Section 11.16.050(a)</a> to the public works commission by filing a written appeal with the public works department no more than ten calendar days after the City provides written notice of intent to install or remove stop signs. The public works commission shall hold a hearing on the appeal and determine whether the proposed stop sign meets the warrant policy described in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/11/16/050/">Section 11.16.050</a>. Notice shall be given in accordance with <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/11/16/070/">Section 11.16.070</a>. At the hearing, the public works commission shall receive testimony and reports and determine whether the safety of, and benefit to, the neighborhood indicate the need for a stop sign at the requested location. The public works commission may approve, disapprove, or modify the decision of the Public Works Director. The public works commission may only authorize the installation of a stop sign previously denied by the Public Works Director if it makes each of the following findings:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Installation of the stop sign will not prevent the street from operating consistently with its functional classification level (arterial, collector or local street) as defined in the General Plan Circulation Element.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Installation of the stop sign will not unduly restrict the delivery of emergency services to the surrounding neighborhood.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Installation of the stop sign will not create any potentially hazardous conflicts with driveways near the intersection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> Installation of a stop sign will not create any significant queuing at the intersection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> Installation of a stop sign is not expected to result in additional accidents at the intersection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)">(6)</span> The installation of a stop sign will not adversely affect any adjacent controlled intersection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(7)">(7)</span> There are no other feasible methods to successfully address the traffic issues associated with the request for the stop sign.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Public works commission decision. Any person may appeal any decision of the public works commission to the City Council by filing a written appeal with the City Clerk no more than ten calendar days after the decision. Notice shall be given in accordance with <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/11/16/070/">Section 11.16.070</a>. The City Council may approve, disapprove, or modify the decision of the public works commission. The decision of the City Council is final.</p>
