The hearing shall be conducted according to the procedures set forth in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8.02.115" title="8.02.115 HEARING PROCEDURES (County § 6.04.115).">Section 8.02.115</a> of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8.02" title="Chapter 8.02 ANIMAL CONTROL">this chapter</a>.</p>

The application for a permit shall contain the name of the applicant, applicant's address, the applicant's home and business phone numbers, the address and description of the proposed location of where the animal will be kept, if different from applicant's, a complete description and a photograph of the animal. The permit shall contain all of the requirements of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8.02.120" title="8.02.120 MANDATORY DANGEROUS ANIMAL PERMIT REQUIREMENTS (County § 6.04.120).">Section 8.02.120</a> and any additional conditions or requirements deemed necessary by the Animal Control Officer or Peace Officer to protect the public health or safety.</p>

The Owner shall submit a written request for a Dangerous Animal Hearing to the Animal Control Officer and/or Peace Officer within five (5) calendar days of written notification by the Animal Control Officer and/or Peace Officer that the animal has been declared dangerous. Should the Owner not submit a request for a hearing within five (5) calendar days of notification, the hearing process shall be deemed waived by the Owner, and the dangerous animal declaration will be considered final by the County Director of the Environmental Services Agency, or the City having jurisdiction. In that event, the County Director of the Environmental Services Agency or the City having jurisdiction may allow the dangerous animal permit to be issued without a hearing. Unless a dangerous animal permit is immediately obtained, the animal shall be impounded at the Owner's expense pending appropriate disposition as determined by the Animal Control Officer and/or Peace Officer.</p>
