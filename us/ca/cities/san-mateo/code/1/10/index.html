To enforce that debt, the Director of Finance or designee may file a claim with the small claims court, or pursue any other legal remedy to collect such money, including by assessment as set forth in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7/42/">Chapter 7.42</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> In addition to the nuisance abatement fee assessed by the administrative citation and any late fee thereto, for appeals which have gone before the Community Relations Commission or City Council, either hearing body may assess administrative costs against the violator. The administrative costs may include any and all costs incurred by the City in connection with the matter before the hearing body including, but not limited to, costs of inspection, investigation, attorneys' fees, staffing costs incurred in preparation for the hearing and for the hearing itself and costs for all reinspections of the subject violation.</p>
