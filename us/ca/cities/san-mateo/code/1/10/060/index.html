Service by first class mail shall be effective on the date of mailing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Failure of any person to file an appeal in accordance with the provisions of this section shall constitute a waiver of that person's rights to contest the merits of the citation and the imposition of the nuisance abatement fee.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> The Community Relations Commission shall determine whether to affirm or dismiss the administrative citation. The Commission may reduce, waive or conditionally reduce the nuisance abatement fee stated in the citations or any late fees assessed based on a showing of good cause. The Commission may impose conditions and deadlines for correction of violations and make such direction to enforcement officers to assure compliance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> The Community Relations Commission shall make findings based on the record of the hearing and make a written decision based on the findings. The City shall preserve all exhibits submitted by the parties for a 180-day period and shall serve the decision by first class mail on the contestant within 10 working days after the hearing. The decision of the Commission may be appealed to the City Council in writing within 10 working days of the day the Commission's decision is served. The appeal before the City Council will follow the same procedures and requirements as the Community Relations Commission hearing.</p>
