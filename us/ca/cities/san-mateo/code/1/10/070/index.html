                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The City Council shall establish the amounts of the nuisance abatement fees, including increased fees for repeat violations, to be assessed for administrative citations by City Council resolution. Correction of any violation within 10 working days of the date the citation was served, as verified by the enforcement officer, will result in a reduction of the nuisance abatement fee by two-thirds for the first violation of a code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> If the violator or property owner fails to correct the violation, subsequent administrative citations may be issued for the same violation(s).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Payment of the nuisance abatement fee shall not excuse the failure to correct the violation nor shall it bar further enforcement action by the City.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> All nuisance abatement fees assessed shall be payable to the City at the address provided on the administrative citation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> If payment of a nuisance abatement fee is not received by the City within 30 calendar days of service of the citation, then a late fee in the amount of 25% of the citation shall be assessed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> The failure of any person to timely pay a nuisance abatement fee assessed by administrative citation or any late fee added thereto, constitutes a debt to the City. To enforce that debt, the Director of Finance or designee may file a claim with the small claims court, or pursue any other legal remedy to collect such money, including by assessment as set forth in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7/42/">Chapter 7.42</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> In addition to the nuisance abatement fee assessed by the administrative citation and any late fee thereto, for appeals which have gone before the Community Relations Commission or City Council, either hearing body may assess administrative costs against the violator. The administrative costs may include any and all costs incurred by the City in connection with the matter before the hearing body including, but not limited to, costs of inspection, investigation, attorneys' fees, staffing costs incurred in preparation for the hearing and for the hearing itself and costs for all reinspections of the subject violation.</p>
