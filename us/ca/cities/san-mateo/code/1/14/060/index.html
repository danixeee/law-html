                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> If the violator or property owner fails to correct the violation by the date due on the compliance order, the Community Relations Commission shall establish an administrative penalty, not to exceed $1,000.00 per day per violation, and a date the penalty and any administrative costs shall be due and payable. In addition to administrative penalties, the Commission may assess administrative costs against the violator. The administrative costs may include any and all costs incurred by the City in connection with the matter before the Community Relations Commission, including, but not limited to, costs of inspection, investigation, attorneys' fees, staffing costs incurred in preparation for the hearing and for the hearing itself, and costs for all reinspections.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Jurisdiction. After the administrative order becomes final, the Community Relations Commission shall maintain continuing jurisdiction until full compliance is achieved and shall have the power to modify the administrative order, after providing the person subject to the administrative order with notice and an opportunity to be heard. Notwithstanding this provision, the City Attorney has independent jurisdiction to pursue alternate remedies for the same violations regardless of the pendency of the administrative proceedings pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/1/14/">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Payment of the administrative penalty shall not excuse the failure to correct the violation nor shall it bar further enforcement action by the City.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> All administrative penalties assessed shall be payable to the City at the address provided on the administrative compliance order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The failure of any person to timely pay an administrative penalty and/or administrative costs imposed by the Community Relations Commission constitutes a debt to the City. To enforce that debt, the Director of Finance or designee may file a claim with the small claims court, or pursue any other legal remedy to collect such money. Administrative costs may be collected as an assessment as set forth in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7/42/">Chapter 7.42</a>.</p>
