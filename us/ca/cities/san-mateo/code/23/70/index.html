If an applicant for a covered project believes that circumstances exist that make it infeasible to meet the requirements of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/70/">this chapter</a>, the applicant may request an exemption as set forth in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/06/015/">Section 23.06.015</a> of the Municipal Code. In applying for the exemption, the burden is on the applicant to show infeasibility. The following conditions may be considered to determine infeasibility:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Where there is insufficient electrical supply.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Where there is evidence suitable to the local enforcing agency substantiating that additional local utility infrastructure design requirements, directly related to the implementation of these requirements, may adversely impact the construction cost of the project.</p>
