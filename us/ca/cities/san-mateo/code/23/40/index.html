No person shall construct, enlarge, alter, repair or maintain any grading, or cause the same to be done, contrary to or in violation of any provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/40/">this chapter</a>. The City Engineer, the Chief of Planning, Building Official, and/or the Director of Parks and Recreation are empowered to investigate and make reports to the Planning Commission on any violations of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/40/">this chapter</a>. The Planning Commission, if it determines from the evidence presented that a violation exists, may recommend to the City Council that action be taken to seek compliance with <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/40/">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(7)(B)">(B)</span> Authority. In the event any person holding a site development permit pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/40/">this chapter</a> violates the terms of the permit, or conducts, carries on or permits to be conducted or carried on said site development in such a manner as materially or adversely to affect the health, welfare, or safety of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the property of the permittee, or conducts or carries on or permits to be conducted or carried on said site development so that it is materially detrimental to the public welfare, or injurious to property, or improvements in the neighborhood, the City Engineer may order a temporary suspension, effective immediately upon notification, and the permittee shall show cause before the Planning Commission that the permit should not be permanently revoked.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(7)(C)">(C)</span> Procedure for Revoking Site Development Permit. No site development permit shall be permanently revoked or suspended until a hearing is held by the Planning Commission. Written notice of such hearing shall be served upon the permittee, either personally or by certified mail. Such notice shall be given the permittee at least five days prior to the date set for the hearing and shall state:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(7)(C)(i)">(i)</span> The grounds for complain or reasons for the revocation or suspension, in clear and concise language;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(7)(C)(ii)">(ii)</span> The time when, and the place where, such hearing is to be held.(D)	Hearing. The Planning Commission shall hold such hearing at the next regularly scheduled meeting at which all conditions of this Subsection can be met. At any such hearing, the permittee shall be given an opportunity to be heard, and he or she may call witnesses and present evidence on his or her behalf. Upon conclusion of such hearing the Planning Commission shall determine whether or not the permit shall be suspended, revoked or modified.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)">(8)</span> Fees.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)(A)">(A)</span> Filing Fees. Filing fees and deposits for services shall be as set forth in fee schedules to be adopted from time to time by the City Council.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)(B)">(B)</span> Consultant Fees. City officers administering <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/40/">this chapter</a> may engage consulting professional services to advise in the review of site development permit applications and may charge not to exceed 100 percent (100%) of the cost of such services to the applicant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(9)">(9)</span> Permit Expiration. Every site development permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the work authorized by such permit has not been commenced within one hundred eighty days, or is not completed within one year from date of issue unless the time is specified on the permit or as provided in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/40/050/#(k)(2)">Section 23.40.050(k)(2)</a>, except that the City Engineer may, if the permit holder presents satisfactory evidence that unusual difficulties have prevented work being started or completed within the specified time limits, grant a reasonable extension of time if written application is made before the expiration date of the permit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(10)">(10)</span> Prohibited Activities.

            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Standards Generally. All grading and grading operations shall comply with the requirements set forth in this Section in addition to other requirements of this Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Hours of Operation. All grading operations shall be restricted to weekdays between the hours of seven a.m. and seven p.m., unless the City Engineer finds evidence that an emergency exists which would imperil or inconvenience the public, in which case he or she may permit the work to proceed during such other hours as may be necessary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Slopes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Vacant Parcels. In evaluating the reasonableness of construction, the reviewing authority may consider, in addition to other factors set forth in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/40/">this chapter</a>, the amount of cut and fill, steepness of driveway, removal of major vegetation, height, bulk and visibility of proposed structures, preservation of natural topographic landforms, and compatibility with the pattern and scale of development within the surrounding neighborhood.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Subdivisions. Subdivisions of sloped properties are limited by San Mateo Municipal Code <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26/20/">Chapter 26.20</a>—Lots (Subdivision Code).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> Limits of Hillside Grading. In R1 and R2 zones, grading on slopes of 25 percent or more shall be limited to site access (driveway) and to building foundations. In all other zoning districts, grading on slopes of 25 percent or more shall be limited to site access only. In all cases, grading shall be designed to limit alteration of the visual character and topography of the hillside while permitting creation of a reasonable building site.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> Finished Cuts of Slopes. The exposed or finished cuts or slopes of any fill or excavation shall be smoothly graded and blended with existing contours by rounding off cut or fill edges and shall be screened with vegetation, and no such fill, slope, cut or inclined graded surface shall exceed a vertical height of thirty feet unless intercepting drains or terraces are provided. Such drains or terraces shall be permanently lined or protected with materials approved by the City Engineer and accumulating surface waters shall be conducted to an approved point of discharge. Any such terrace or intercepting drain shall be designed to prevent overflow which may cause erosion. All exposed slopes of any cut or fill subject to erosion shall be protected by approved planting, crib walls, walls and planting, terracing, or a combination thereof. The use of visible retaining walls shall be minimized, and where visible, shall be screened with vegetation. Graded surfaces exceeding an area of five thousand square feet shall be treated as provided in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/40/050/#(j)">Section 23.40.050(j)</a>. The City Engineer may require that corrective measures be taken if he or she finds the material being cut or used for fill is unusually subject to erosion, or if other conditions affect the stability of the slopes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> Seasonal Grading. All grading shall be limited to the dry season (April 15 through October 15) unless the City Engineer determines adequate erosion control is provided. For commencement of grading during the wet season, the permittee shall demonstrate that grading is relatively minor and that erosion and sedimentation can be controlled. The City Engineer shall have the ability to grant or deny permission under this Section on the basis of weather forecasts, experience, and other pertinent factors.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Dust and Dirt. All graded surfaces of any nature shall be wetted, or otherwise suitably contained to prevent nuisance from dust or spillage on city streets or adjacent properties. Equipment, materials and roadways on the site shall be used in a manner or treated as to prevent excessive dust conditions. Dust and dirt control activities shall not result in any material entering the storm drain system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Fill Material. All fill shall be earth, rock or other inert mineral materials free from organic material and free from metal, except that topsoil spread on cut and fill surfaces may incorporate humus for desirable moisture retention properties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Drainage. Adequate provision shall be made to prevent any surface waters from damaging the cut face of an excavation or any portion of a fill. All drainage ways and structures shall carry surface waters to the nearest street, storm drain or natural watercourse capable of receiving them without producing erosion as approved by the City Engineer as a safe place to deposit and receive such waters. Parcels shall not be graded so as to direct additional water, or to alter the existing pattern of drainage, onto adjacent properties. The City Engineer may require such drainage structures to be constructed, or installed, as are necessary to prevent erosion damage, or to prevent saturation of the fill or material behind cut slopes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Street and Driveway Grades.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> Maximum Grades. Maximum grades for new streets and driveways shall be as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(A)">(A)</span> Collector and Local Streets: 15%</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(B)">(B)</span> Intersections: 8%</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)(C)">(C)</span> Private Roads, Driveways and Ramps that have no pedestrian access and are not emergency vehicle access easements: 18%</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> Design. Streets and driveways shall be designed in accordance with standard engineering practices by a registered civil engineer. Design of any street or driveway shall demonstrate consideration of such factors as surrounding topography, drainage, pedestrian access, the presence of intersections, driveways, and/or bicycle lanes, vehicular volume and type, and vehicular operation. The flattest grade that reasonably fits the topography should be used and appropriate transitions (vertical curves) between changes in grade are required.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> Backfilling. Any pipe trench or other trenching or excavation made in any slope of an excavated or filled site shall be backfilled to the level of the surrounding grade. Such backfill shall be compacted to the original density of the excavated materials, but in no case less than ninety (90%) percent of the maximum density achieved by an AASHO soil compaction test method, selected by the City Engineer. Suitable check drains to control erosion shall be installed as directed by the City Engineer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> Compaction of Fill. all fills intended to support buildings, structures, or where otherwise required to be compacted for stability of material, shall be compacted, inspected and tested in accordance with adopted specifications on file in the office of the City Engineer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> Erosion Control—Landscaping. All cut and fill surfaces created by a grading process, agricultural processes excepted, shall be planted with a ground cover that is acceptable to a soils engineer and compatible with ground covers in general use in the area, and is one that will thrive with little or no maintenance once established. Topsoils are to be stockpiled during rough grading and used on cut and fill slopes to a depth sufficient to support the proposed plant materials in a manner acceptable to a soils engineer. On slopes likely to be extensively disturbed by later construction, an interim ground cover may be planted or emplaced to be supplemented by the permanent ground cover and/or shrubs and trees when the site is finally developed and landscaped. When slopes have been permitted too steep to support continuous ground cover, and in lieu thereof niches and ledges have been provided for planting, such slopes need not be planted with a continuous ground cover, but may instead be screened with vines and plantings. Cuts and fills along public roads may be required to be landscaped and graded so as to blend into the natural surroundings. All plant materials shall be satisfactory to the superintendent of parks and/or City Engineer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span> Special Precautions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(1)">(1)</span> If, at any stage of the grading, the City Engineer determines by inspection that the nature of the earth formation is such that further work as authorized by an existing permit is likely to imperil any property, public way, watercourse or drainage structure, he or she may require, as a condition to allowing the work to proceed, that such reasonable safety precautions be taken as he or she considers advisable to avoid likelihood of such peril. "Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to, specifying a flatter exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, or implementation of other relevant BMPs: and reports of a registered soils engineer and/or of a registered engineering geologist whose recommendations may be made requirements for further work.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(k)(2)">(2)</span> Where it appears that storm damage may result because the grading is not complete, work may be stopped and the permittee required to install temporary planting or otherwise to control erosion, install temporary structures or take such other measures as may be required to protect adjoining property or the public safety. On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail, the City Engineer may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion, or may require that the operation be conducted in specific stages so as to insure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.</p>
