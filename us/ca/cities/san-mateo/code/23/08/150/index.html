                <p><strong>Section 3109.1.1 Location. </strong>A swimming pool may be placed or constructed in any of the required yard areas provided the pool is constructed at ground level and provided the following setbacks are maintained:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">(a)</span> For single-family dwellings, the inside face of the pool shall not be less than four feet from any property boundary of the lot or parcel on which the pool is located.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="">(b)</span> For multifamily dwellings, the inside face of an outdoor pool shall be not less than twenty feet from any property boundary. Indoor swimming pool structures for multifamily dwellings shall also be subject to the setback requirements for accessory buildings, as designated in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/70/">Chapter 27.70</a> of the Zoning Code, with the exception that the minimum clearance of 4 feet to the property line and 5 feet to surrounding buildings shall still apply.</p>
