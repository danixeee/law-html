                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> <strong>General.</strong> Construction or work for which a permit is required shall be subject to inspection by the building official and the construction or work shall remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes until approved by the building official. In addition, certain types of construction shall have continuous inspection as specified in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/06/130/">Section 23.06.130</a>.</p>
                <p>Approval as a result of an inspection shall not be construed to be an approval of a violation of the provisions of this code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction. Inspections presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid.</p>
                <p>It shall be the duty of the permit applicant to cause the work to remain accessible and exposed for inspection purposes. Neither the building official nor this jurisdiction shall be liable for expense entailed in the removal or replacement of any material required to allow inspection.</p>
                <p>A survey of the lot may be required by the building official to verify that the structure is located in accordance with the approved plans.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> <strong>Inspection Record Card.</strong> Work requiring a permit shall not be commenced until the permit holder or the agent of the permit holder shall have posted or otherwise made available an inspection record card such as to allow the building official conveniently to make the required entries thereon regarding inspection of the work. This card shall be maintained available by the permit holder until final approval has been granted by the building official.</p>

The building official may require that every request for inspection be filed at least one working day before such inspection is desired. Such request may be in writing or by telephone at the option of the building official.</p>
                <p>It shall be the duty of the person requesting any inspections required either by this code or the technical codes to provide access to and means for inspection of the work.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> <strong>Approval Required. </strong>Work shall not be done beyond the point indicated in each successive inspection without first obtaining the approval of the building official. The building official, upon notification, shall make the requested inspections and shall either indicate that that portion of the construction is satisfactory as completed or shall notify the permit holder or an agent of the permit holder wherein the same fails to comply with this code. Any portions which do not comply shall be corrected and such portion shall not be covered or concealed until authorized by the building official.</p>
                <p>There shall be a final inspection and approval of all buildings and structures when completed and ready for occupancy and use.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> <strong>Required Building Inspections.</strong> Reinforcing steel or structural framework of a building or structure shall not be covered or concealed without first obtaining the approval of the building official.

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> <strong>Foundation Inspection. </strong>To be made after excavations for footings are complete and required reinforcing steel is in place. For concrete foundations, required forms shall be in place prior to inspection. All materials for the foundation shall be on the job, except when concrete is ready-mixed in accordance with approved nationally recognized standards, the concrete need not be on the job. When the foundation is to be constructed of approved treated wood, additional inspections may be required by the building official.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> <strong>Concrete Slab or Under-Floor Inspection.</strong> To be made after in-slab or under-floor building service equipment, conduit, piping accessories and other ancillary equipment items are in place but before any concrete is placed or floor sheathing installed, including the subfloor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(3)">(3)</span> <strong>Frame Inspection. </strong>To be made after the roof, framing, fire blocking and bracing are in place and all pipes, chimneys and vents are complete and the rough electrical, plumbing, and heating wires, pipes, and ducts are approved.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> <strong>Lath and/or Wallboard Inspection. </strong>To be made after lathing and wallboard, interior and exterior, is in place but before plaster is applied or before wallboard joints and fasteners are taped and finished.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(5)">(5)</span> <strong>Final Inspection. </strong>To be made after finish grading and the building is completed and ready for occupancy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> <strong>Required Building Service Equipment Inspections.</strong></p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)">(1)</span> <strong>General. </strong>Building service equipment for which a permit is required by this code shall be inspected by the building official. Building service equipment intended to be concealed by a permanent portion of the building shall not be concealed until inspected and approved. When the installation of building service equipment is complete, an additional and final inspection shall be made. Building service equipment regulated by the technical codes shall not be connected to the water, fuel or power supply, or sewer system until authorized by the building official.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span> <strong>Operation of Building Service Equipment.</strong> The requirements of this section shall not be considered to prohibit the operation of building service equipment installed to replace existing building service equipment serving an occupied portion of the building in the event a request for inspection of such building service equipment has been filed with the building official not more than 48 hours after the replacement work is completed, and before any portion of such building service equipment is concealed by permanent portions of the building.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)">(3)</span> <strong>Other Inspections.</strong> In addition to the explicit inspections specified above, the building official may make or require other inspections of construction work to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this code or technical codes and other laws which are enforced by the code enforcement agency.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(5)">(5)</span> This section is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of the technical codes, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or reinspection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(6)">(6)</span> Reinspection fees may be assessed when the inspection record card is not posted or otherwise available on the work site, the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the building official.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(7)">(7)</span> To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall file an application therefore in writing upon a form furnished for that purpose, and pay the reinspection fee in accordance with the fee schedule adopted by this jurisdiction.</p>
