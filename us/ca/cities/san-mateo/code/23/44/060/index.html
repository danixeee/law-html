No permit or approval shall be issued which does not conform to all applicable provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/">Title 23</a>, Buildings and Construction, and <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/">Title 27</a>, Zoning Code. The determination of conformance shall be made by the Community Development Director or designated staff members of the Community Development Department.</p>
                <p>Where the application meets the requirements of the approved checklist and standards and there are no specific, adverse impacts upon public health or safety, the building division shall complete the building permit approval process, which is nondiscretionary. Review of the application for electric vehicle charging stations shall be limited to the building official's review of whether the application meets local, state, and federal health and safety requirements. If an application is deemed incomplete, a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information or documentation required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance shall be sent to the applicant for resubmission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The building official may only deny an application for the electric vehicle charging station permit if the official makes written findings based upon substantial evidence in the record that the proposed installation would have a specific, adverse impact upon public health or safety and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the adverse impact. Such findings shall include the basis for the rejection of the potential feasible alternative for preventing the adverse impact.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The building official may require an applicant to apply for an "electric vehicle charging station use permit" if the building official finds, based on the initial application submittal, that the electric vehicle charging stations could have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health and safety.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Notwithstanding the appeal provisions contained in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/06/040/">Section 23.06.040</a>, the building official's determinations under this section may be appealed to the Planning Commission.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> A separate fire inspection may be performed by the City of San Mateo Fire Department, if required.</p>
