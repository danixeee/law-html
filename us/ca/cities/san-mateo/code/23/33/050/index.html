The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading values used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable state or local building standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(i)(2)">(2)</span> All new construction and other development shall be located on the landward side of the reach of mean high tide.</p>
