                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Application of Development Standards. Development standards contained in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a> shall apply to all development located within an area of special flood hazard. Formal City approval in the form of a building permit or some other development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development begins within any area of special flood hazard. Application of these development standards shall be made by use of forms furnished by the Floodplain Administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The City Manager for the City of San Mateo or designee is appointed to administer, implement, and enforce <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Making determinations concerning the implementation of the requirements of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a> on development projects within the City of San Mateo and to determine that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(i)">(i)</span> Permit requirements of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a> have been satisfied;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(ii)">(ii)</span> All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)(iv)">(iv)</span> The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a>, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point; and</p>

Building permits shall not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition.</p>
