In examining this requirement, the City will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates or may purchase the property with knowledge that it is within the special flood hazard area.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(gg)">(gg)</span> "Hardship" as related to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/060/">Section 23.33.060</a>, Alternate Design Standard Procedure, of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a> means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested alternate design standard. The City requires that the need for the alternate design standard be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting an alternate design standard, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(hh)">(hh)</span> "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(ii)(3)">(3)</span> Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(ii)(4)">(4)</span> Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior.</p>

            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Applicability. Alternate design standards may be approved for new construction or, substantial improvements necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a> are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood, does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. The alternate design standard criteria set forth in this section pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. An alternate design standard may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a> would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.</p>
                <p>Initial determination regarding issuance of a permit based upon alternate design standards shall be by the Floodplain Administrator.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Requirements for Alternate Design Standards.</p>

As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the alternate design standard increases.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Alternate design standards may be approved for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the alternate design standard is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Alternate design standards shall not be approved within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> Alternate design standards shall only be approved upon a determination that the alternate design standard is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a>. For example, in the case of alternate design standards to an elevation requirement, this means the City need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Required Findings for Use of Alternate Design Standards. Alternate design standard shall only be approved upon the Building Official's determination that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> There is showing of good and sufficient cause;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> Failure to grant the alternate design standard would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/020/">Section 23.33.020</a> of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a>) to the applicant; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> The approval of an alternate design standard will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, public safety nuisance, fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Conditions of Approval. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection (a) and the purposes of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a>, the Building Official may attach such conditions to the granting of alternate design standard as he or she deems necessary to further the purposes of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23/33/">this chapter</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(10)">(10)</span> Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(11)">(11)</span> Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Notice. Any applicant to whom an alternate design standard is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the Floodplain Administrator or designee that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> The approval of an alternate design standard to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.</p>
                <p>A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the office of the San Mateo County Recorder so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.</p>
