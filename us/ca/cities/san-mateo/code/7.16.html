If the Council finds that such a nuisance does exist or such an order should issue, the Council may order the nuisance or violation to be abated, may further require the abatement within a specified time period, and may impose such further conditions on the abatement as the Council finds are just and proper. In the alternative, the Council may send the complaint to the Community Relations Commission or any other board or commission for further hearing and investigation, or the Council may take such other action as the Council determines is appropriate. A copy of the order will be posted on the premises involved on the following work day. If the owners of the premises are not present at the hearing, a copy of the order will be delivered to the owners as was provided for the hearing notice.</p>
