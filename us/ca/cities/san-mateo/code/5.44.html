Accordingly, it is the purpose and intent of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5.44" title="Chapter 5.44 MASSAGE">this chapter</a> to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by providing for the orderly regulation of businesses providing massage therapy services, discouraging prostitution and related illegal activities carried on under the guise of massage therapy, and establishing certain sanitation, health, and operational standards for massage businesses.</p>
