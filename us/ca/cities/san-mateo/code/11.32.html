                <p>A Residential Parking Permit Program is hereby approved and authorized for use in all residential districts or appurtenant to any authorized residential use. The excessive parking of nonresident vehicles on residential streets is detrimental to the integrity of the residential neighborhood.

The Director of Public Works is authorized to propose policies and procedures implementing a Residential Parking Permit Program. Those policies and procedures shall be reviewed by the Sustainability and Infrastructure Commission who shall thereafter make recommendations to the City Council for adoption. Such policies and procedures shall be consistent with the purpose of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/11.32" title="Chapter 11.32 STOPPING, STANDING AND PARKING">this chapter</a>.
