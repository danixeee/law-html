This review shall be conducted in the same manner as all other reviews by the Commission under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27" title="Title 27 ZONING">this title</a>, except that notice to the owners of property within 300 feet of the site as required by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27" title="Title 27 ZONING">this title</a> shall also be given 10 days before the hearing date.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In making its determination, the Community Relations Commission may rely on dated photographs showing the site before, but not more than six months before, the project was approved and any time after the approval. In the absence of or in addition to this photographic evidence, the Commission may base its decision on the testimony of any two eyewitnesses giving evidence of deterioration or on a written report by the landscape resources, building, or bureau of fire prevention and life safety divisions or the health official based on on-site inspections by the reporting official before and after approval of the project. The Commission shall permit testimony from the public at the hearing.</p>
