                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> <span class="level-heading">REQUIREMENTS.</span> An annual license fee shall be paid for every dog or cat over the age of four (4) months owned or harbored in this city that has adopted the provisions of this ordinance. Said annual license fee shall be first due when the animal reaches four (4) months of age or within 60 days after the dog or cat is acquired, and due on the anniversary date of the original purchase date each year thereafter. New residents shall have sixty (60) days in which to acquire such license. Persons renewing their license shall have thirty (30) days following their due date before being delinquent and having to pay a late penalty. The fee for such license shall be as set forth in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8.02.290" title="8.02.290 SCHEDULE OF FEES AND CHARGES (County § 6.04.290).">Section 8.02.290</a>. The fee paid for the licensing of spayed or neutered dogs or cats shall be less than said license fee for unaltered dogs or cats upon presentation of the proper certification. The license fee paid by persons over the age of 60 shall be at a discount. For purposes of this section any surcharge on the license fee imposed under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8.02.290" title="8.02.290 SCHEDULE OF FEES AND CHARGES (County § 6.04.290).">Section 8.02.290</a> shall not be considered part of the license fee. Any person who shall fail to pay such license fee after said fee is due, or said dog or cat is required to be licensed, shall in addition to paying any past due license fee or fees, also pay a penalty in accordance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8.02.290" title="8.02.290 SCHEDULE OF FEES AND CHARGES (County § 6.04.290).">Section 8.02.290</a>. A license shall be obtained, but no license fee shall be payable for the licensing of any dog being raised, trained or used to assist handicapped persons (such as those provided by Canine Companions) including but not limited to any dog which is being trained for guide or hearing purposes by a resident of the City or used for guide or hearing purposes by a handicapped resident of the City and which has come from a guide or hearing dog training facility such as Canine Companions, or for dogs which have served as a member of the armed forces of the United States of America, or any dog used by a local law enforcement agency for the purposes of crime prevention or control. Dog or cat licenses are not transferable between owners; however, if the dog or cat dies and the owner acquires a new dog or cat, the license is transferable to the new dog or cat. The license does not have to be renewed until the original purchase anniversary date. The fee paid for a dog or cat license is not refundable. Licenses herein provided for shall be signed by the Animal Control Program Manager.</p>
