                <p>In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the State of California under <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=22660&amp;lawCode=VEH" title="">Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code</a> to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the City Council makes the following findings and declarations:</p>
                <p>The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, including highways, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects, and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles, or parts thereof, on private or public property, including highways, except as expressly permitted in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7.17" title="Chapter 7.17 ABANDONED VEHICLES">this chapter</a>, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7.17" title="Chapter 7.17 ABANDONED VEHICLES">this chapter</a>.</p>
