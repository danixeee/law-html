                <p>The purpose of this ordinance is to establish purchasing procedures for the City of San Mateo. The City Council finds that a flexible purchasing system that allows for consideration of price, quality, reliability, workmanship, compatibility of products (such as computers and cellular equipment or design and furniture), and other relevant factors is in the public's best interests and that no single factor should be determinative in every case.</p>
                <p>The City Council further finds that the complexity of City of San Mateo purchases and construction contracts, in conjunction with the complexities of the private marketplace, require that city staff and this Council have flexibility to select among the purchasing alternatives set forth in this ordinance in order to obtain the best products, services, and construction in the public's interest.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3.60.040#(a)(2)">(2)</span> Opening of Bids. All bids shall be sealed, identified as such and submitted to the City Clerk or the department supervising the project on or before the date and time set for opening. Bids received after the specified time shall be returned to the bidder unopened; provided, however, the bids received prior to the opening of the first bids shall be considered to be timely. Bids shall be opened in public at the time specified in the notice.</p>

The City Council may, in its discretion, waive any minor irregularities or informalities in the bids received. The award may be to the lowest responsible bidder or other bidder. In determining to whom the award is to be made, the City Council may consider, in addition to the bid price received, the experience of the bidder for the particular service sought, the quality of work the bidder has done, the quality of the product or materials provided by the bidder, the ability of the bidder to complete the project in a timely manner, the safety compliance record of the bidder, the insurance carried by the bidder, the information provided by the pre-qualification process, and the after sales service and support that is provided, as well as other factors that the City Council determines to be relevant in the particular situation.</p>

If no bids are received, the City Council may have the project done or purchase made without further compliance with <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3.60" title="Chapter 3.60 PURCHASING">this chapter</a>.</p>

                <p>Professional services shall, whenever appropriate, be based on negotiations with at least two professionals.</p>
