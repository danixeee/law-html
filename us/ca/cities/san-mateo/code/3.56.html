The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel.

                <p>Each operator shall, on or before the last day of each month, make a return to the Tax Collector, on forms provided by the Tax Collector, of the total rents charged and the amount of tax calculated for transient occupancies for the preceding month. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax Collector. The Tax Collector may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he or she may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3.56" title="Chapter 3.56 TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX">this chapter</a> shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax Collector.</p>

As soon as the Tax Collector procures such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3.56" title="Chapter 3.56 TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX">this chapter</a> and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the Tax Collector shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3.56" title="Chapter 3.56 TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX">this chapter</a>. In case such determination is made, the Tax Collector shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of address. Such operator may within 10 days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax Collector for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Collector, shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Collector shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Collector shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/3.56.130" title="3.56.130 APPEAL.">Section 3.56.130</a>.</p>
