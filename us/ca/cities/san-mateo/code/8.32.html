                <p>In the event that the Building Division has denied such permit, or has made provisions with reference thereto which such applicant does not wish to carry out, the applicant may appeal from such decision to the Community Relations Commission. Such appeal shall be filed in writing with the building official no later than 30 days from and after the date on which such applicant has received notice of such rejection or order for modification. The building official shall set the time for hearing such appeal before the Community Relations Commission which shall be at a regular meeting of the Commission. The appeal will be heard at the next regular meeting following public notification and after the legal noticing time has been allowed. The building official shall forthwith notify the applicant in writing of the date set for such hearing. If the applicant is not the owner of the property, the owner will be notified of the appeal. The owner will be responsible to see that decisions of the building official and/or the Community Relations Commission are complied with. Owners of properties within 300 feet of applicant's property will be notified of the hearing. At the hearing on such appeal, the Community Relations Commission may hear all evidence introduced by the applicant and others, with reference to such matter, and it shall thereupon make its decision thereon. At such time it shall find whether or not the proposed keeping of such fowl and rodents would be injurious to the health, safety or welfare of the City. It shall thereupon allow, or deny, such applications, or make such provisions for modifications thereof, and with reference thereto, as it may see fit. Appeals of the Commission's decision may be made to the City Council by filing in writing within 10 calendar days of the hearing and paying the required filing fee.</p>
