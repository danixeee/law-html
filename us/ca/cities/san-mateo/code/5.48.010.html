Such statement shall contain the name and location of the company or firm for which the orders are to be solicited or secured, the name of the nearest local or state manager, if any, and his or her address, the kind of goods, wares or merchandise to be delivered, the place from which the same are to be shipped or forwarded, the method of solicitation or taking orders, the location of any warehouse, factory or plant within the state, the method of delivery, the name and location of the residence of the applicant, and any other facts necessary to establish such claim of exemption. A copy of the order blank, contract form, or other papers used by such person in taking orders shall be attached to the affidavit for the information of the bureau.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> No such applicant shall engage in such business without payment of a business tax under the provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5" title="Title 5 BUSINESS LICENSES AND REGULATIONS">this title</a>, for the business in which the applicant intends to engage, unless a certificate of exemption, under the provisions of this section, has first been issued to applicant by the Tax Collector.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Such applicant, at the time of the filing of such verified statement, shall also file a photograph of applicant taken, within sixty days immediately prior to the date of filing such application, and showing head and shoulders of applicant. Applicant shall also file a set of his or her fingerprints.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> A service charge of five dollars shall be made at the time of filing such application for expenses in connection therewith, and paid to the Tax Collector.</p>

The provisions of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5.18" title="Chapter 5.18 APPEAL AND REVIEW—REVOCATION—REFUSAL">Chapter 5.18</a> with reference to the notice, place and time of the hearing, and all procedure in connection therewith shall apply in the event of such appeal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> If, at such hearing, the Council has found that payment of a business tax would cast a burden on applicant's right to engage in commerce with foreign countries, or among the several states, or would conflict with laws of the United States respecting interstate commerce, the Council shall cause such certificate of exemption to be issued. If, at such hearing, the Council has found otherwise, such exemption shall be denied.</p>
