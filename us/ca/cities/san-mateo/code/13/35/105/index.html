                <p>In all cases where Street Trees are removed or damaged to the extent described in subsection (b) below, the Director may require replacement by anyone participating in an unlawful act, as defined in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/35/085/">section 13.35.085</a>, or the permittee, in accordance with the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Tree replacement shall be in accordance with the Street Tree Master</p>
                <p>Plan and shall be a maximum of a 48" box tree for each Street</p>
                <p>Tree removed, as determined in the discretion of the Director, depending on the value of the tree removed and whether the removal was in violation of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/35/">this chapter</a>. Replacement, as determined by the Director may be in a different location than the location from which removal occurred.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In the event Trimming of a Street Tree or other cause results in damage to the tree compromising its health or structural integrity or is severely detrimental to its overall aesthetics, the Director may require replacement by the person or entity causing the damage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> If the Street Tree that is removed is a heritage tree, the provisions for replacement of heritage trees shall apply in the discretion of the Director.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Where the Director determines that replacement is not feasible and/or appropriate, the Director (1) may require that a payment of equal value to the cost of the purchase and installation of the replacement tree(s) be made to the City tree planting fund or (2) may place other conditions on the permit which are of equal value to the cost of the purchase and installation of the replacement tree(s).</p>
