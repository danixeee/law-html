In addition to the replacement requirements described in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/35/105/">Section 13.35.105</a>, if the Director finds that any person or entity has violated <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/35/">this chapter</a> by participating in any act constituting a violation under <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/35/085/">section 13.35.085</a> of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/35/">this chapter</a>, the Director may impose a penalty of up to $5,000 per participant per tree for such unlawful act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In addition to all other remedies set forth in this code or otherwise provided by law, the following remedies shall be available to the City for violation of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/35/">this chapter</a>:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> Anyone violating the provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/35/">this chapter</a> may be directed by the Building Official or other inspector to stop work conducted under a City permit on either public or private property when such work caused or contributed to the violation and to prepare a mitigation plan to correct the violation and mitigate the damage inflicted. Once the violation is corrected and mitigation implemented, the Building Official or other inspector shall allow construction to resume. The mitigation plan shall be filed and approved by the City Arborist, agreed to in writing by the property owner(s) and either implemented or guaranteed by the posting of adequate bond or other security. The mitigation plan shall include measures for protection of any remaining Street Trees or heritage trees on the property or in the adjacent right-of-way and shall provide for replacement of each tree removed or damaged at locations approved by the Director. The replacement ratio shall be determined by the Director according to the provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/35/">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> If a violation occurs in the absence of development, or while an application for a building or encroachment permit or discretionary development approval is pending in the area of either public or private property affected by the violation, the Building Official or other inspector may condition the issuance of any building or encroachment permit or planning approval upon the completion of a study, to be conducted by the City or consultant designated by the City, at the expense of the property owner, for the purpose of providing the City an opportunity to consider and determine appropriate mitigation measures for any tree removal and to insure measures are incorporated into any future development approvals for the property for the protection of any remaining Street Trees or heritage trees in the affected area.</p>
