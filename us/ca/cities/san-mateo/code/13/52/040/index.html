                <p>Any person or entity desiring to remove or prune one or more heritage trees shall apply to the Director for a permit. The application for a permit shall be made on forms provided for this purpose and shall state, among other things, the number and location of the trees to be removed or pruned by types and the reason for removal or pruning of each. The request for such a permit may only be made by the owner or owners of the property on which the trees are located or for pruning by an adjacent property owner of heritage tree limbs extending onto that adjacent property, after notice of the application to the property owner where the heritage tree is located. Heritage tree permits are valid for six months from date of issue. Extensions may be authorized by the Director. The applicant may submit an arborist's report with the permit application to show cause for removal or pruning. Pruning permit applications shall include pruning specifications prepared by a certified arborist.</p>
                <p>The Director shall review each application and shall consider and determine the following in rendering a decision:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The condition of the tree or trees with respect to disease, danger of falling, proximity to existing or proposed structures and interference with utility services;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The necessity to remove the tree or trees in order to construct any proposed improvements to allow reasonable economic enjoyment of the property.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The topography of the land and the effect of the removal of the tree on erosion, soil retention and diversion or increased flow of surface waters.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The number of trees existing in the neighborhood on improved property and the effect the removal would have on the established standard of the area and property value.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The number of trees the particular parcel can adequately support according to good arboricultural practices.</p>
                <p>In reviewing applications, the Director shall give priority to those based on hazard or danger of disease. (S)he may refer any application to another department, committee, board or commission of the City for a report and recommendation or may require the applicant to supply a certified arborist's report.</p>
