                <p><a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/52/">This chapter</a> is adopted because the City has been forested with a variety of healthy and valuable trees which must be protected and preserved, the preservation and reforestation of which is necessary for the health and welfare of the citizens of this city in order to preserve the scenic beauty; maintain property values; prevent erosion of topsoil; protect against flood hazards and the risk of landslides; counteract the pollutants in the air; maintain the climatic balance and decrease wind velocities; and relieve the public costs of installing and maintaining stormwater drainage systems. To this end it is reasonable to expect property owners to maintain their trees in a satisfactory condition to keep the City of San Mateo as a sylvan place to live.</p>
                <p>It is the intent of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/52/">this chapter</a> to establish regulations for the protection, removal and preservation of heritage trees within the City in order to retain as many trees as possible consistent with the purpose hereof and the reasonable economic enjoyment of private property.</p>

The application for a permit shall be made on forms provided for this purpose and shall state, among other things, the number and location of the trees to be removed or pruned by types and the reason for removal or pruning of each. The request for such a permit may only be made by the owner or owners of the property on which the trees are located or for pruning by an adjacent property owner of heritage tree limbs extending onto that adjacent property, after notice of the application to the property owner where the heritage tree is located. Heritage tree permits are valid for six months from date of issue. Extensions may be authorized by the Director.

Pruning permit applications shall include pruning specifications prepared by a certified arborist.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Trees removed with a valid tree removal permit shall be replaced in accordance with the direction of the Director. Replacement direction shall include direction on the location and species of the replacement tree. Tree replacement shall be one 24" box size tree approved by the Director, for each tree removed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Trees removed without a valid tree removal permit shall be replaced by a 48" box size tree for each tree removed.

In such cases, the determination of the level of replacement shall be within the discretion of the Director, but shall not exceed the actual tree loss as determined by the Replacement Value. In addition to the requirements of this subsection, penalties under <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/52/055/">Section 13.52.055</a> or other sanctions allowed by law may be imposed for removal of heritage trees without a permit.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Any person causing damage to a heritage tree shall be required to take such steps as may be required by the Director to assure the future vitality of the tree, including costs of treatment and/or construction of protective barriers, or if the Director determines that the damage is so great that the tree is no longer reasonably sustainable, replacement of the damaged tree per subsection (c), above.</p>

In addition to the Reforestation requirements described in Section 13.52.050(c)(e), if the Director finds that any person has violated <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/52/">this chapter</a> by participating in any act constituting a violation under <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/52/030/">Section 13.52.030</a>, the Director may impose a penalty of up to $5,000 per participant per tree for such illegal act.</p>

Once the violation is corrected and mitigation implemented, the Building Official or inspector shall allow construction to resume. The mitigation plan shall be filed and approved by the City Arborist, agreed to in writing by the property owner(s) and either implemented or guaranteed by the posting of adequate bond or other security.

The replacement ratio shall be determined by the Director according to the provisions of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/52/">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> If a violation occurs in the absence of development, or while an application for a building permit or discretionary development approval for the lot upon which the tree is located is pending, the Building Official may condition the issuance of any building permit or approval upon the completion of a study, to be conducted by the City or consultant designated by the City, but in either case at the expense of the property owner, for the purpose of providing the City an opportunity to consider and determine appropriate mitigation measures for the tree removal and to insure measures are incorporated into any future development approvals for the property for the protection of any remaining heritage trees in the area.</p>
