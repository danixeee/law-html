                <p>Permits for heritage tree removal, removals without permits and causing damage to heritage trees shall require replanting conditions in accordance with the following guidelines:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Trees removed under jurisdiction of a planning approval pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27/71/">Chapter 27.71</a> shall conform with the replacement conditions specified in the planning approval.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Trees removed with a valid tree removal permit shall be replaced in accordance with the direction of the Director. Replacement direction shall include direction on the location and species of the replacement tree. Tree replacement shall be one 24" box size tree approved by the Director, for each tree removed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Trees removed without a valid tree removal permit shall be replaced by a 48" box size tree for each tree removed. Enhanced replant conditions may be imposed if it is determined by the Director that the value of the removed tree was significantly greater than that of a 48" box tree. In such cases, the determination of the level of replacement shall be within the discretion of the Director, but shall not exceed the actual tree loss as determined by the Replacement Value. In addition to the requirements of this subsection, penalties under <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/13/52/055/">Section 13.52.055</a> or other sanctions allowed by law may be imposed for removal of heritage trees without a permit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Where the Director determines that replanting is not feasible and/or appropriate, e.g., sufficient trees exist on site, the Director (1) may require that a payment of equal value to the cost of the purchase and installation of the replacement tree(s) be made to the City tree planting fund or (2) may place other conditions on the permit which are of equal value to the cost of the purchase and installation of the replacement tree(s).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Any person causing damage to a heritage tree shall be required to take such steps as may be required by the Director to assure the future vitality of the tree, including costs of treatment and/or construction of protective barriers, or if the Director determines that the damage is so great that the tree is no longer reasonably sustainable, replacement of the damaged tree per subsection (c), above.</p>
