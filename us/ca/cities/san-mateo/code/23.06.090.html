                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> <span class="level-heading">Issuance.</span> The application, plans, specifications, computations and other data filed by an applicant for permit shall be reviewed by the building official or his designees. Such plans may be reviewed by other departments of this jurisdiction to verify compliance with any applicable laws under their jurisdiction. If the building official finds that the work described in an application for a permit and the plans, specifications and other data filed therewith conform to the requirements of this code and the technical codes and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and that the fees specified in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/23.06.120" title="23.06.120 FEES.">Section 23.06.120</a> have been paid, the building official shall issue a permit therefor to the applicant.</p>
                <p>When a permit is issued for required plans, the building official shall endorse in writing or stamp the plans and specifications "APPROVED." Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorizations from the building official, and all work regulated by this code shall be done in accordance with the approved plans.</p>
                <p>The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a building or structure before the entire plans and specifications for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this code. No building permit for construction of a superstructure shall be issued unless a complete superstructure application is made not later than 90 days after issuance of a foundation permit and a superstructure permit is taken out not later than six months after issuance of the foundation permit. For purposes of this section, the determination of whether a building or structure is a superstructure shall be made by the building official. The holder of a partial permit shall proceed at his own risk without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> <span class="level-heading">Retention of Plans.</span> One set of approved plans, specifications and computations shall be retained by the building official for a period of not less than 90 days from the date of completion of the work covered therein; and one set of approved plans and specifications shall be returned to the applicant and shall be kept on the site of the building or work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> <span class="level-heading">Validity of Permit.</span> The issuance of a permit or approval of plans, specifications and computations shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, a violation of any of the provisions of this code or the technical codes, or of any other ordinance of the jurisdiction. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be valid.</p>
                <p>The issuance of a permit based on plans, specifications and other data shall not prevent the building official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans, specifications and other data, or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of these codes or of any other ordinance of this jurisdiction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> <span class="level-heading">Expiration.</span> Every permit issued by the building official under the provisions of the technical codes shall expire by limitation and become null and void, if the building or work authorized by such permit is not commenced within 180 days from the date of such permit, or if the building or work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the work is commenced for a period of 180 days. Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so, and the fee therefor shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work and provided further that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit over one year after expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee.</p>
                <p>A foundation permit shall expire by limitation and become null and void, unless a complete superstructure application is made not later than 90 days after issuance of a foundation permit and a superstructure permit is taken out not later than six months after issuance of the foundation permit.</p>
                <p>A permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within which work may commence under that permit when the permittee is unable to commence work within the time required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The building official may extend the time for action by the permittee for a period not exceeding 180 days upon written request by the permittee showing that circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have prevented action from being taken and that extension will not result in violation of this code or any other laws. Permits shall not be extended more than two times.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> <span class="level-heading">Suspension or Revocation.</span> The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this code and the technical codes when the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of an ordinance or regulation or the provisions of these codes.</p>
