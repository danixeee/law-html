                <p>Abandoned shopping carts constitute a nuisance, create potential hazards to the health and safety of the public, and interfere with pedestrian and vehicular traffic within the City of San Mateo. The accumulation of wrecked, dismantled and abandoned shopping carts on public or private property also tends to create conditions that reduce property values, promoting blight and deterioration in the City. The intent of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.29" title="Chapter 17.29 SHOPPING CART REMOVAL, IMPOUNDMENT, DISPOSAL">this chapter</a> is to insure that measures are taken by store owners to prevent the removal of shopping carts from store premises and parking lots, to make the removal of shopping carts a violation of this Code, and to facilitate the retrieval of abandoned carts as permitted by State law.</p>
