                <p>In the event that the County enforces <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/89/">this chapter</a> on the City's behalf within the City limits, the following administrative fine provisions apply:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Grounds for Fine. A fine may be imposed upon findings made by the Director of the Environmental Health Division, that any food vendor has used polystyrene-based disposable food service ware in violation of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/89/">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Amount of Fine. Upon a finding of violation, the food vendor shall be subject to an administrative fine as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> A fine not exceeding $100.00 for a first violation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> A fine not exceeding $200.00 for a second violation; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> A fine not exceeding $500.00 for the third and subsequent violations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Each day that a food vendor uses polystyrene-based disposable food service ware when providing prepared food shall constitute a separate violation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Fine Procedures. Notice of the fine shall be served on the food vendor. The notice shall contain an advisement of the right to request a hearing before the Director of the Environmental Health Division or designee contesting the imposition of the fine. The grounds for the contest shall be either that: (1) the food vendor did not use polystyrene-based disposable food service ware when providing prepared food; or (2) the food vendor would have been granted an exemption of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/89/">this chapter</a> if the food vendor had applied for such exemption. Said hearing must requested within 10 days of the date appearing on the notice of the fine. The decision of the Director of the Environmental Health Division shall be based upon a finding that one of the above listed grounds for a contest have been met and shall be a final administrative order, with no administrative right of appeal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Failure to Pay Fine. If said fine is not paid within 30 days from the date appearing on the notice of the fine or of the notice of determination of the Director of the Environmental Health Division or designee after the hearing, either the City or the County is authorized to bring an action to collect any unpaid administrative fine.</p>
