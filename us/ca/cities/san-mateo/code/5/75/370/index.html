Such taximeter shall be at all times subject to inspection by the Chief of Police, and the Chief of Police is authorized at his or her instance or upon complaint of any person, to investigate such taximeter or cause it to be investigated, and upon the discovery of any inaccuracy in such meter, to remove or cause to be removed such vehicle equipped with the taximeter from the streets of the City until such time as the taximeter has been correctly adjusted; provided, that the City Manager may in writing permit the operation of a taxicab unequipped with a taximeter on the terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, rates, and for the time specified in such a written permit, a copy of which permit must be displayed in the passenger's compartment of a taxicab.</p>
