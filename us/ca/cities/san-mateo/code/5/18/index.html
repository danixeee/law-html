                <p>The board may issue an order to show cause, giving at least five (5) days' written notice by mail to the business concerned of a hearing to be held before the board at a time and place to be fixed in the notice, why the permit or certificate should be issued, or if issued, why it should not be suspended until the claimed violation has been corrected, or why the permit or certificate should not be revoked, or why a fee for inspection of the premises, in an amount specified in the notice, of not less than five (5) dollars nor more than $50.00, should not be fixed for payment by the business.</p>
                <p>The determination of the board shall be subject to appeal by any interested person to the Council.</p>
                <p>If the permit or certificate is revoked or suspended, the Tax Collector may, in his or her discretion, refund a portion of the tax or fee paid by the business. The portion is to be prorated for the period during which the business is inoperative due to the revocation or suspension, for the balance of the period covered by the certificate or permit.</p>
