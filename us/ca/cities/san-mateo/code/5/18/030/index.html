The Council shall forthwith set the matter for hearing and cause notice of the time and place thereof to be given by mail to the appellant, and, in any case, the affected business, not less than five (5) days prior to such hearing. At the hearing the appellant shall appear and offer evidence in support of his or her appeal. The Council shall have the power to confirm, reverse, modify, or correct the determination of the board, committee, or manager in any regard. If proper showing is made entitling such appellant to a certificate or permit, the Council shall authorize the granting of the certificate or permit, or its continuation, as the case may be, on such terms and conditions as it shall determine and not inconsistent with this code, shall determine the proper fee or tax to be charged, and shall cause written notice to be given by mail to the appellant and the affected business of its determination and of the amount of the fee or tax, if any.</p>
