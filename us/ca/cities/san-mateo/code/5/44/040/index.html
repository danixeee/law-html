                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Issuance. Upon provision by the massage business of the foregoing documentation, the Chief of Police shall issue the massage business a City registration certificate, which shall be valid for two years from the date of issuance. No reapplication will be accepted within one year after an application or renewal is denied or a certificate is revoked. City registration certificates shall not be issued to a massage business seeking to operate at a particular location if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> Another massage business is or was operating at that particular location and that massage business is currently serving a suspension or revocation pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/44/110/">Section 5.44.110</a>, during the pendency of the suspension or one year following revocation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> Another massage business is or was operating at that particular location and that massage business has received a notice of suspension, revocation, or fine issued pursuant to Sections <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/44/100/">5.44.100</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/44/110/">5.44.110</a>, during the 10-day period following receipt of the notice or while any appeal of a suspension, revocation or fine is pending.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> Another massage business is or was operating at that particular location and that massage business has outstanding fines issued pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/44/100/">Section 5.44.100</a> that have not been paid.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Amendment. A massage business shall apply to the City to amend its City registration certificate within 30 days after any change in the registration information, including, but not limited to, the hiring or termination of certified massage practitioners, the change of the business's address, or changes in the owner's addresses and/or telephone numbers.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Renewal. A massage business shall apply to the City to renew its City registration certificate at least 30 days prior to the expiration of said City registration certificate. If an application for renewal of a City registration certificate and all required information is not timely received and the certificate expires, no right or privilege to provide massage shall exist.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Fees. There shall be no fee for the registration application or certificate, or any amendment or renewal thereof. The provisions of this section shall not prevent the City from establishing fees for safety inspections as may be conducted from time to time by the Chief of Police, and for the background checks, fingerprinting, and subsequent arrest notification for owners of a massage business who are not CAMTC-certified and who are subject to such background checks pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/44/">this chapter</a>. There are certain fees for appeals as described below.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Transfer. A City registration certificate shall not be transferred except with the prior written approval of the Chief of Police. A written request for such transfer shall contain the same information for the new ownership as is required for applications for registration pursuant to this section. In the event of denial, notification of the denial and reasons therefor shall be provided in writing and shall be provided to the applicant by personal delivery or by registered or certified mail. A City registration certificate may not be transferred during any period of suspension or one year following revocation pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/44/110/">Section 5.44.110</a>, during the 10-day period following a massage business's receipt of a notice of suspension, revocation or fine issued pursuant to Sections <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/44/100/">5.44.100</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/44/110/">5.44.110</a> or while any appeal of a suspension, revocation or fine is pending. Further, a City registration certificate may not be transferred until all outstanding fines issued pursuant to <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/5/44/100/">Section 5.44.100</a> have been paid.</p>
