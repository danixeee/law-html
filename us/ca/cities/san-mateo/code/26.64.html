Private Park and Recreational Facility Space credit is calculated by first dividing the cumulated park and recreation facility space that qualifies for credit by the total park land dedication requirement and then by multiplying this result by the maximum credit allowable. For example:</p>
                <p>If the cumulated amount of Park and Recreational Facility Space that qualifies for credit = 5,000 square feet (SF), and</p>
                <p>Park land dedication requirement = 15,000 SF, and</p>
                <p>The maximum allowable credit = 50%, then:</p>
                <p>5,000 SF / 15,000 SF = .333</p>
                <p>Therefore .333 x 50% max = 16.65% credit for project off of the fee.</p>
