                <p>The purpose of the CBD Support District is to encourage commercial uses which both support traditional downtown (CBD) uses as well as serve adjacent residential neighborhoods. It is intended that the commercial uses in this area will serve as a link between the Gateway and CBD. Residential uses will also be encouraged in order to provide housing opportunities for downtown employees, as well as existing and future residents.</p>
