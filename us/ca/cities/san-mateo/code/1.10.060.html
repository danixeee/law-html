The Commission may impose conditions and deadlines for correction of violations and make such direction to enforcement officers to assure compliance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> The Community Relations Commission shall make findings based on the record of the hearing and make a written decision based on the findings.
