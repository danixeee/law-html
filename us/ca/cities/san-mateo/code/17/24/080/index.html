                <p>The notice of cost shall allow the Property Owner to appeal the determination as to the responsible Property Owner(s) of the amount owed. The request to appeal the claim must be in writing and filed within 10 calendar days of the date of the Director of Public Works notice to the Property Owner of the cost of repair. The appeal shall designate with particularity the decision, action or determination appealed from and the remedy or relief sought by way of the appeal. The appeal shall be filed with the Public Works secretary, who shall set the hearing for the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Public Works Commission. At the hearing, the commission shall receive all evidence offered by the Property Owner and City staff. At the conclusion of the hearing, the commission shall make its findings. If the commission finds that the initial decision, action or determination that is appealed from is consistent with the provisions and policies of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17/24/">this chapter</a> and is not otherwise injurious to the public health, safety or welfare, then the appeal shall be denied. If it finds that the initial decision, action or determination is either inconsistent with the provisions and policies of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17/24/">this chapter</a> or is otherwise injurious to the public health, safety or welfare, then the commission may sustain the appeal and in its decision grant any remedy or relief sought by the Property Owner, or such other relief as it deems appropriate, that is consistent with the provisions and policies of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17/24/">this chapter</a>. Any interested person may appeal the decision of the commission to the City Council by filing an application with the City Clerk's Office, including any required fees, within 10 calendar days of the decision. The decision of the Council shall be final.</p>
