                </p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> The current limited control of the design, placement, installation, and maintenance of News Dispensers on and within the public rights of way interferes with and obstructs the use of such public rights of way, threatens the safe passage of pedestrians and vehicles, and further obstructs and interferes with the safe and reasonable use of private property adjoining, or in the vicinity of, such public rights of way, and further adversely impacts the aesthetics of the City creating structural and visual clutter and this Ordinance will reduce such negative impacts;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The public health, safety, welfare, and convenience require that, in connection with the use, maintenance and placement of News Dispensers, interference with vehicular, bicycle, wheelchair, or pedestrian traffic must be avoided, obstruction of sight distance and views of traffic signs and crosswalks must be eliminated, damage done to sidewalks or streets must be minimized and repaired, good appearance of the public streets and grounds must be maintained, trees and other landscaping must be allowed to grow without disturbance and overcrowding due to proximity to News Dispensers, access to emergency and other public facilities must be maintained, and ingress and egress from properties adjoining the public rights of way must be protected and this Ordinance will assist in meeting these goals;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The placement and maintenance of News Dispensers on or within public rights of way is historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers, periodicals, and other publications and that such use shall not be denied or unreasonably restricted and this Ordinance will accomplish this goal;</p>

                <p>Due to the unique nature of the Downtown Area, additional criteria should be applied to the Downtown Area to preserve and enhance both the appearance and function of both private and public improvements in the Downtown Area, as well as to ensure the ability of businesses to operate without unreasonable interference from News Dispensers and this Ordinance will assist in accomplishing this goal.</p>

In conjunction with the Publishers and interested adjacent property or business owners, the Director of Public Works shall determine the number of Modular Newsracks and the size and the location at which they will be placed. The final determination of each placement of Modular Newsracks shall be in the discretion of the Director of Public Works, but shall be exercised based upon the following criteria:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Is the placement consistent with the goal of eliminating pedestrian congestion and enhancing pedestrian safety in the Mandatory Modular Area?</p>

            <h1>17.12.070 PRIORITIES IN MODULAR NEWSRACKS.</h1>
            <section>
              <section class="line-group primary-content">
                <p>At such time as this Ordinance becomes effective, the Director shall begin the process of replacing Freestanding Newsracks with Modular Newsracks within the Mandatory Modular Area. For this initial replacement process, space within Modular Newsracks in the Mandatory Modular Area shall be assigned in the following order of priority:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Priority amongst Publishers desiring space in the Area shall be based on a lottery system conducted by the Director. The number of available compartment spaces shall be determined applying the criteria set forth in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17/12/030/">Section 17.12.030</a>. A random selection from all of the participating Publishers for each non-site specific space shall be made by rounds. At such time as a Publisher has determined it has sufficient space for its needs, its name shall be eliminated from subsequent rounds. When the number of remaining rounds is the same as the original number of participating Publishers, the Director shall ask if any Publishers have yet to receive any compartment space. All Publishers who have yet to receive any compartment space shall then be given one compartment space. Any remaining spaces shall be randomly selected by rounds, as before, until there are no remaining spaces. A second random selection shall determine the specific location that each space will be assigned. Trading, selling, giving or other method of transferring assigned space to another Publisher, person or entity shall not be allowed. Any Publisher desiring additional space after the lottery process is complete shall be placed on the priority list discussed in subsection (d) below.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Alternative Method. As an alternative to the lottery system, all participating Publishers may present to the Director an agreed upon distribution plan for the available spaces in the Mandatory Modular Area. If approved by the City Council applying the criteria set forth in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17/12/030/">Section 17.12.030</a>, this agreed upon distribution plan will become the basis for the initial modular assignments.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Vacancies. A Publisher with assigned compartment space may at any time return such space to the City by stating in writing its intent to do so. The City, or its Operator, shall thereafter remove the compartment and replace it with that of the next in line Publisher, or a space keeper box if there is no one on the priority list.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Priority List. A priority list shall be created by the Director for the determination of assignment of compartment space as vacancies occur after the initial modular assignments under subsection (a) or (b) above. Priorities when vacancies occur in Modular Newsracks shall be established in the following order: (1) Publications maintaining permitted Free Standing Newsracks within the Mandatory Modular Area on June 18, 2002, that were not able to secure the desired number of spaces in Modular Newsracks as a result of the lottery procedure implemented pursuant to Subsection (a)., above, or were not included in any stipulated plan implemented under Subsection (b), above. If there are more than one Publication meeting this definition, priority within such group shall be based upon whichever historically has maintained Freestanding Newsracks in the Mandatory Modular Area for the longest period of time; (2) other Publications shall be given priority based upon the chronological sequence of the submittal of permit applications ("first-come, first-served" basis).</p>
                <p>Priorities shall be recorded on a priority list maintained by the Director. Placement on the priority list shall entitle the Publisher to the next available vacant space when its name comes to the top of the list. If the Publisher declines the next available space, it may rather choose to be placed at the bottom of the priority list. If thereafter the Publisher desires additional spaces, its name shall be placed again at the bottom of the list and another space provided when its name comes up again. A Publisher who is not then currently on the priority list may be placed on the list at any time by filing a permit application for Compartment space within the Mandatory Modular Area. As an alternative to being placed upon the priority list, a Publisher may choose to apply for a new Modular Newsrack location under <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17/12/060/">section 17.12.060</a> (b)(2).</p>

                <p>Any News Dispenser which is placed, installed or maintained on, within, or projecting into any Public Right Of Way shall comply with the following standards and design:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Freestanding Newsracks.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Color and Design. Freestanding Newsracks may be painted any color. Freestanding Newsracks may be of the following types: an 80 or 100 style or a Ganset style, or a type equivalent to one or more of the foregoing examples, as determined by the Director. As used herein "equivalent" means a Newsrack of the same general size and style.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Dimensions. No Freestanding Newsrack shall exceed fifty inches in height including the pedestal, measured from the ground to the top surface of the Freestanding Newsrack, thirty inches in width and twenty-four inches in depth.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Modular Newsracks.

As used herein "equivalent" means a Modular Newsrack of the same general size and style and which is structurally compatible with the Modular stand and existing Compartments.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Each News Dispenser that requires a deposit of money to obtain the Publication shall be equipped with a coin-return mechanism to permit persons using the machine to secure a refund in the event they are unable to receive the Publication. The coin-return mechanism shall be maintained in good working order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Each permittee shall have its name, current address, telephone and facsimile numbers (updated within 15 days of changes) affixed to its News Dispenser or Compartment in a place where such information will be readily visible and shall include instructions on how to receive a refund in the event of a coin-return malfunction. The information shall be prominently displayed on the News Dispenser or Compartment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> In order to eliminate visual clutter created by a multitude of Freestanding Newsracks, where there are five or more Newsracks within the public right of way that are located within 50 lineal feet of each other, the Newsracks shall be replaced by Modular Newsracks. Thereafter, any additional News Dispensers in that area shall be Modular Newsracks. The Director shall provide a sixty-day period to comply with <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17/12/">this chapter</a> after it gives notification to affected Publishers that Modular Newsracks are required. Any cost associated with the replacement of Freestanding Newsracks by Modular Newsracks shall be borne jointly and equally by the owners of each of the Freestanding Newsracks to be replaced by Modular Newsracks.</p>

If no Permit Application can be found for the News Dispenser, posting of the notice on the News Dispenser alone shall be sufficient. The notice shall direct the permittee, or if no permit has been issued, the owner/user of the News Dispenser or Compartment to contact the Director of Public Works or designee. Unless the notice of intent is to determine it an Abandoned News Dispenser or Compartment, (see Subsection (c) below) the notice shall also state the nature of the violation, shall specify actions necessary to correct the violation, and shall give the owner or user ten business days from the date of posting of the notice to either remedy the violation or to request a meeting before the Director or designee. The notice shall also provide a telephone contact number.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Meeting and Decision. Any owner or user notified pursuant to subsection (1) above, may request a meeting with the Director or designee by making a written request within ten business days from the date appearing on the notice. The meeting shall be informal but oral and written evidence may be given by both sides. The Director or designee shall give his or her decision within ten business days after the date of the meeting. Unless the owner or user fails to appear at the meeting, any action by the City to remove the News Dispenser or recapture the Compartment shall be stayed pending the written decision following the meeting.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Removal and Impoundment. The City may remove and impound a News Dispenser or recapture a Compartment following the written decision upholding the determination of a violation under subsection (2) above, or if the owner or user has neither requested a meeting nor remedied the violation within ten business days from the latter of the date the notice described in subsection 1 above was mailed or posted. An impounded News Dispenser shall be retained by the City for a period of at least thirty calendar days following the removal, and may be recovered by the permittee upon payment of a fee as set forth in the City of San Mateo Comprehensive Fee Schedule. An impounded News Dispenser and its contents may be disposed of by the City after thirty calendar days.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> Summary Abatement. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (A)	and (B), prior notice and an opportunity to be heard shall not be required prior to removal of any News Dispenser that is installed or maintained in such place or manner as to pose an immediate or clear and present danger to persons, vehicles or property. In such case, the City shall proceed in the following manner:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)(A)">(A)</span> Within the next working day following removal/recapture, the Director or designee shall notify by telephone the permittee or, in the case of an unpermitted News Dispenser or Compartment, the owner or user. Within three business days, the Director or designee shall send written confirmation of the telephoned notice. The written confirmation shall contain the reasons for the removal/recapture and information supporting the removal/recapture, and shall inform the recipient of the right to request, in writing or in person within ten business days of the date of such written notice, a post-removal/recapture meeting.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)(B)">(B)</span> Upon timely request, the Director or designee shall provide a meeting within forty-eight hours of the request, unless the requesting party agrees to a later date. The proceeding shall be informal, but oral and written evidence may be given by both sides. The Director or designee shall give his or her decision in writing to the requesting party within forty-eight hours after such meeting. If the Director or designee finds that the removal/recapture was proper, he or she shall notify the requesting party to pay any applicable penalties and costs and recover the News Dispenser or contents of the Compartment. If the Director or designee finds that the removal/recapture was improper and that placement of the News Dispenser or use of the Compartment was lawful, the Director or designee shall order that the News Dispenser or contents of the Compartment be released and reinstalled without charge.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)(C)">(C)</span> If the owner of an unpermitted News Dispenser or Compartment cannot be determined and the News Dispenser/Compartment does not contain the required identification, no notice of the removal shall be required.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Any Abandoned Compartment within a Modular Newsrack in the Mandatory Modular Area may be recaptured, sold and reassigned by the Director to another user after following the notice procedures described in subsection (a)(1) above. If no claim of ownership is made within 20 days of such notice, the City may sell and reassign the Compartment to another Publisher. Any Abandoned Freestanding Newsrack may be removed from the right-of-way after the 20-day notice period and impounded and disposed of if not claimed within 30 days of removal.</p>
