                <p>Any News Dispenser which is placed, installed or maintained on, within, or projecting into any Public Right Of Way shall comply with the following standards and design:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Freestanding Newsracks.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Color and Design. Freestanding Newsracks may be painted any color. Freestanding Newsracks may be of the following types: an 80 or 100 style or a Ganset style, or a type equivalent to one or more of the foregoing examples, as determined by the Director. As used herein "equivalent" means a Newsrack of the same general size and style.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> Dimensions. No Freestanding Newsrack shall exceed fifty inches in height including the pedestal, measured from the ground to the top surface of the Freestanding Newsrack, thirty inches in width and twenty-four inches in depth.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Modular Newsracks. All Modular Newsracks shall be painted Sho-Rack standard green and shall be of the following types: a 97 or 98 style Concourse model and a 49-16 style, or a type equivalent to one or more of the foregoing examples, as determined by the Director. As used herein "equivalent" means a Modular Newsrack of the same general size and style and which is structurally compatible with the Modular stand and existing Compartments.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Each News Dispenser that requires a deposit of money to obtain the Publication shall be equipped with a coin-return mechanism to permit persons using the machine to secure a refund in the event they are unable to receive the Publication. The coin-return mechanism shall be maintained in good working order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Each permittee shall have its name, current address, telephone and facsimile numbers (updated within 15 days of changes) affixed to its News Dispenser or Compartment in a place where such information will be readily visible and shall include instructions on how to receive a refund in the event of a coin-return malfunction. The information shall be prominently displayed on the News Dispenser or Compartment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> In order to eliminate visual clutter created by a multitude of Freestanding Newsracks, where there are five or more Newsracks within the public right of way that are located within 50 lineal feet of each other, the Newsracks shall be replaced by Modular Newsracks. Thereafter, any additional News Dispensers in that area shall be Modular Newsracks. The Director shall provide a sixty-day period to comply with <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17/12/">this chapter</a> after it gives notification to affected Publishers that Modular Newsracks are required. Any cost associated with the replacement of Freestanding Newsracks by Modular Newsracks shall be borne jointly and equally by the owners of each of the Freestanding Newsracks to be replaced by Modular Newsracks.</p>
