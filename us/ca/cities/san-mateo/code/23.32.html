                <p>All on-site fire protection facilities shall be, at all times, maintained in accordance with the Uniform Fire Code. The Fire Chief and his or her authorized representatives are empowered, at his or her discretion, to enter upon the land and conduct periodic tests and inspections of said facilities. If the Fire Chief determines that any on-site fire protection facilities are being maintained in such manner as not to meet national standards, he or she shall order the owner to make such repairs, alterations or additions as shall conform the facilities to national standards. The Fire Chief shall designate a reasonable time within which such repairs, alterations or additions are to be made and it is unlawful for any person so ordered willfully to fail or refuse to comply with such order. A copy of the order of the Fire Chief shall be served upon each tenant. Without limiting the foregoing, the willful failure or refusal to comply with such an order constitutes an occupancy violation within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the building code.</p>
