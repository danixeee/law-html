                <p>Any Owner of a dangerous animal shall insure compliance with the following rules and regulations which shall be mandatory requirements for any dangerous animal permit:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> When the animal is off the property of its Owner, the Owner must ensure that the animal is restrained with a leash not to exceed four (4) feet in length and having a minimum tensile strength of 300 pounds and shall be under the direct control and supervision of the Owner or a person of such age, size and strength as can easily control such animal. Extraordinary care shall be taken by the Owner to ensure that such restraint is sufficient to control the animal in a manner which it will not endanger other persons or animals.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The Owner shall maintain the animal so that it is not a threat to any mail carrier, sanitation worker, meter person, or other person who has the lawful right to enter the property.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The Owner shall ensure that the animal is not kept upon any unenclosed premise unless it is leashed and controlled by a person capable of controlling such animal. The Owner shall ensure that the animal is not tethered, tied or staked at any unenclosed premise. The Owner shall ensure that the animal is not kept in a house or structure when the windows or doors are open or screen doors are the only obstacle preventing the animal from exiting the structure.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> The Owner shall ensure that the animal is kept in a fenced yard, kennel, run or enclosure approved by the Animal Control Officer or Peace Officer. The Owner shall ensure that all structures used to confine the animals are locked with a key or combination lock when such animals are within the structure. The Owner shall regularly inspect the fenced yard, kennel, run or enclosure to ensure that it is secure to maintain the animal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> The Owner shall open premises upon which an animal is maintained at any reasonable hour for inspection by the Animal Control Officer or Peace Officer and said premises shall be surrendered for inspection by the Owner upon the request of the Animal Control Officer or Peace Officer. The Owner shall pay a fee for the costs incurred by County for the inspection or re-inspection of property. Such fee shall be set forth in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8/02/290/">section 8.02.290</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> The Owner of the dangerous animal shall post the entrances to the property where the animal is kept with a legible sign conspicuous to the public warning persons of the presence of a dangerous animal. The Owner of the dangerous animal shall obtain an approved sign from the Animal Control Program for a non-refundable fee and shall surrender such sign in the event of the revocation of the permit, death of animal, or approved relocation of the animal, or upon any other reasonable demand by an Animal Control Officer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> The Owner of any dangerous animal must advise all members who reside in the same household and on the same premises of the conditions established by the permit for keeping or maintaining said dangerous animal.</p>

The Owner shall ensure that the dangerous animal be micro-chipped and registered with the Animal Control Program for a fee specified by <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8/02/290/">Section 8.02.290</a> within thirty (30) calendar days from the date the permit was issued.
