                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> The dangerous animal Owner or any person the Owner has allowed to have possession of the animal has violated any local animal ordinances, or is in violation of any zoning, health and safety or building ordinance or Penal Code section relating to the keeping, care or use of any animals;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The Owner or any person the Owner has allowed to have possession of the animal has violated any rules, regulations or conditions of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8/02/">this chapter</a> including but not limited to dangerous animal permit conditions, or any requirement imposed by the Animal Control Officer, Peace Officer or Hearing Officer as necessary to insure the animal will not endanger the peace, health or safety of any person or property; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The Owner has changed the location of his or her residence or his or her place of business or sells, assigns, transfers, donates, leases, or otherwise disposes of the animal for which the permit was issued.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In the event that it is reasonably necessary to protect against a threat to the health or safety of the public, or of any animal, the Animal Control Officer or Peace Officer may impound or cause to be impounded the animal while an investigation is taking place.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> If, after investigation, the Animal Control Officer or Peace Officer concludes that it is probable that one or more of the above grounds for revocation or modification of the permit has occurred, the Officer shall cause written notice thereof to be transmitted to the Owner. Said notice shall specify the grounds of revocation or modification of the permit. Should the Owner of the animal wish to contest the revocation or modification of the permit, (s)he may request a hearing to be held before a hearing officer not previously involved with the permit issuance or investigation, as designated by the Director of the Environmental Services Agency within five (5) calendar days of receiving the notice of intent to modify or revoke permit. Said hearing date shall be not less than five (5) working days or more than 15 working days subsequent to the date the request for hearing is received. The hearing shall be conducted as set forth in <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8/02/115/">section 8.02.115</a> of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8/02/">this chapter</a>. After the hearing, the Officer conducting the hearing may modify the terms of the permit or revoke the permit depending upon the Owner's ability to comply with the requirements of <a class="internal-link" href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8/02/">this chapter</a> and to control the animal so that the health, safety and property of the public are protected.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Upon written or oral notification by the Animal Control Officer, or Hearing Officer if a hearing was held, of any modifications to a dangerous animal permit, the Owner shall immediately comply with such modified permit requirements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> Upon written or oral notification by the Animal Control Officer, or Hearing Officer if a hearing was held, of the revocation of a permit for a dangerous animal, the Owner of such animal shall within two (2) calendar days of such notification surrender said animal to an Animal Control Officer to be humanely destroyed or provide written proof to an Animal Control Officer in the form of declaration(s) under penalty of perjury that such animal has been permanently removed from the County of San Mateo and declaring the new location or new address where the animal is to be kept.</p>
