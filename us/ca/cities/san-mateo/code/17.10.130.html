                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(4)(A)">(A)</span> does not meet the findings required in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/17.10.130#(d)(3)" title="">Section 17.10.130(d)(3)</a>;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(6)">(6)</span> <span class="level-heading">Appeals.</span> Any applicant may appeal the approval authority's written decision to deny without prejudice an application for section 6409 approval. The written appeal together with any applicable appeal fee must be tendered to the City Clerk within ten calendar days from the approval authority's written decision and must state in plain terms the grounds for reversal and the facts that support those grounds. The City Manager shall be the appellate authority for all appeals from the approval authority's written decision to deny without prejudice an application for section 6409 approval. The City Manager shall review the application <em>de novo</em>; provided, however, that the City Manager's decision shall be limited to only whether the application should be approved or denied in accordance with the provisions in this Section and any other applicable laws. The City Manager shall issue a written decision that contains the reasons for the decision, and such decision shall be final and not subject to any further administrative appeals.</p>
