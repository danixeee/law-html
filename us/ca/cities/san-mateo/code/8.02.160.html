                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> The dangerous animal Owner or any person the Owner has allowed to have possession of the animal has violated any local animal ordinances, or is in violation of any zoning, health and safety or building ordinance or <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codesTOCSelected.xhtml?tocCode=PEN&amp;tocTitle=+Public+Utilities+Code+-+PEN" title="">Penal Code</a> section relating to the keeping, care or use of any animals;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The Owner has changed the location of his or her residence or his or her place of business or sells, assigns, transfers, donates, leases, or otherwise disposes of the animal for which the permit was issued.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> In the event that it is reasonably necessary to protect against a threat to the health or safety of the public, or of any animal, the Animal Control Officer or Peace Officer may impound or cause to be impounded the animal while an investigation is taking place.</p>

Said notice shall specify the grounds of revocation or modification of the permit. Should the Owner of the animal wish to contest the revocation or modification of the permit, (s)he may request a hearing to be held before a hearing officer not previously involved with the permit issuance or investigation, as designated by the Director of the Environmental Services Agency within five (5) calendar days of receiving the notice of intent to modify or revoke permit. Said hearing date shall be not less than five (5) working days or more than 15 working days subsequent to the date the request for hearing is received. The hearing shall be conducted as set forth in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8.02.115" title="8.02.115 HEARING PROCEDURES (County § 6.04.115).">section 8.02.115</a> of <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/8.02" title="Chapter 8.02 ANIMAL CONTROL">this chapter</a>.
