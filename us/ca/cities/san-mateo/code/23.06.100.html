                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Demolition permits may be issued if at least one of the following is applicable:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> Demolition has been ordered by the building official because of major structural damage or a condition resulting in imminent or immediate danger to public health or safety; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> A building permit or site development permit has been issued authorizing work to be performed which requires the prior removal of an existing structure to accomplish the new construction; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> The City has determined that demolition is necessary in order to perform appropriate soil tests for a proposed project; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(4)">(4)</span> Demolition is required by the City as a condition of approval of a planning application under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27" title="Title 27 ZONING">Title 27</a> or a subdivision under <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/26" title="Title 26 SUBDIVISIONS">Title 26</a> of this code, and the application for the demolition permit complies with the time frame set in the condition of approval.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(5)">(5)</span> The demolition involves a nonresidential structure of 3,000 square feet or less.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)">(6)</span> The building official finds that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)(i)">(i)</span> The structure is not habitable due to violations of Property Maintenance Code or the Building Standards Code as adopted by the City of San Mateo or local, State or Federal laws; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)(ii)">(ii)</span> Substantial evidence has been provided that repair of the structure is not feasible. As used in this subsection "feasible" means capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, legal, social and technological factors. Evidence provided by the applicant may be independently reviewed by consultants hired by the City at the applicant's expense; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(6)(iii)">(iii)</span> Demolition of the structure would have a less significant effect on the neighborhood than allowing the existing dilapidated structure to remain.</p>
                <p>A demolition permit shall not be issued pursuant to this subsection unless notice of the proposed demolition and appeal procedures is posted on the premises in a location visible from off-site at least 15 days before issuance of the demolition permit. Pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/2.21.030" title="2.21.030 POWERS—DUTIES.">Section 2.21.030</a>, the building official's proposal to issue a demolition permit is appealable to the Community Relations Commission within the 15-day posting period by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk. If demolition is requested as part of a planning application pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27.68.020" title="27.68.020 REQUIREMENT.">Section 27.68.020</a>, the Planning Commission shall review the request as required by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/27.68.020" title="27.68.020 REQUIREMENT.">Section 27.68.020</a> prior to any action by the building official.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(7)">(7)</span> The demolition involves a non-required accessory building.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(8)">(8)</span> The demolition of structures where a master plan or specific plan has been approved for development of the site provided that: (1) the building official receives written confirmation that the demolition is needed to facilitate the timely construction of new structures under the approved master plan; (2) the structures are substantially vacant; (3) there is written documentation from a lending institution that the project (at least in substantial part) is capable of being financed and the applicant is credit worthy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> All demolition permits shall comply with the following conditions:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> If the site is a service station or listed on the Hazardous Waste and Substances Sites List (prepared pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=65962.5&amp;lawCode=GOV" title="">Government Code Section 65962.5</a>), or if the City has any other substantial evidence that the site may contain hazardous wastes, the application for a permit must be accompanied by evidence that the soil has been inspected for contamination and, if contamination has been found, that a plan has been submitted to and approved by the San Mateo County Division of Environmental Health.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> The site shall be fenced when open holes in the ground exist, if required by the building official because of other hazards or to ensure maintenance of the site.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> All debris, weeds, and other nuisances shall be removed from the site, and the site shall be leveled unless requirements regarding hazardous wastes make leveling infeasible. If planting is not required by subsection (b)(4), and construction does not commence within 30 days after demolition, the soil shall be treated with a weed inhibitor approved by the City.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> If deemed appropriate, the City may require that the entire site be planted and maintained with a drought tolerant ground cover that will fully cover all exposed soil within six months of planting, or covered to a minimum depth of two inches with crushed rock.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(5)">(5)</span> That the site be fenced according to code, or if deemed appropriate, the City may require that any driveway curb cuts not used be provided with bollards and chains, located and installed so as to prevent vehicular entry into the site.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(6)">(6)</span> The applicant shall comply with all other conditions that may be attached by the building official to ensure maintenance of the site, including, but not limited to, vacant lot maintenance requirements contained in <a class="internal-link " href="/us/ca/cities/san-mateo/code/7.48" title="Chapter 7.48 VACANT LOT MAINTENANCE">Chapter 7.48</a> of the San Mateo Municipal Code.</p>
